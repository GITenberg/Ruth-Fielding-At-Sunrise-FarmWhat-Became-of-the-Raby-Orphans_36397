<h1><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_1'></a>1</span>Ruth Fielding at Sunrise Farm</h1>
<h2><a name='chI' id='chI'></a>CHAPTER I—SWEET BRIARS AND SOUR PICKLES</h2>
<p>
The single gas jet burning at the end of the
corridor was so dim and made so flickering a light
that it added more to the shadows of the passage
than it provided illumination. It was hard to discover
which were realities and which shadows in
the long gallery.
</p>
<p>
Not a ray of light appeared at any of the transoms
over the dormitory doors; yet that might
not mean that there were no lights burning within
the duo and quartette rooms in the East Dormitory
of Briarwood Hall. There were ways of
shrouding the telltale transoms and—without
doubt—the members of the advanced junior
classes had learned such little tricks of the trade
of being a schoolgirl.
</p>
<p>
At one door—and it was the portal of the
largest “quartette” room on the floor—a tall
figure kept guard. At first this figure was so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2'></a>2</span>
silent and motionless that it seemed like a shadow
only. But when another shadow crept toward
it, rustling along the wall on tiptoe, the guard
demanded, hissingly:
</p>
<p>
“S-s-stop! who goes there?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh-oo! How you startled me, Madge
Steele!”
</p>
<p>
“Sh!” commanded the guard. “Who goes
there?”
</p>
<p>
“Why—why—— It’s <em>I</em>.”
</p>
<p>
“Give the password instantly. Answer!”
commanded the guard again, and with some vexation.
“‘I’ isn’t anybody.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, indeed? Let me tell you that <em>this</em> ‘I’
is somebody—according to the gym. scales. I
gained three pounds over the Easter holidays,”
said “Heavy” Jennie Stone, who had begun her
reply with a giggle, but ended it with a sigh.
</p>
<p>
“Password, Miss!” snapped the guard,
grimly.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! of course!” Then the fat girl whispered
shrilly: “‘Sincerity—befriend.’ That is
what ‘S.&nbsp;B.’ stands for, I s’pose. Sweetbriars!
and I have a big bag of sour pickles to offset the
cloying sweetness of the Sweetbriars,” chuckled
Heavy. “Besides, they say that vinegar pickles
will make you thin——”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t need them for that purpose,” admitted
the guard at the door, still in a whisper,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3'></a>3</span>
but accepting the large, “warty” pickle Heavy
thrust into her hand.
</p>
<p>
“Will make <em>me</em> thin, then,” agreed the other.
“Let me in, Madge.”
</p>
<p>
The guard, sucking the pickle convulsively the
while, opened the door just a little way. A blanket
had been hung on a frame inside in such a
manner that scarcely a gleam of lamplight
reached the corridor when the door was open.
</p>
<p>
“Pass the Sweetbriar!” choked Madge, with
her mouth full and the tears running down her
cheeks. “My goodness, Jennie Stone! these
pickles are right out of vitriol!”
</p>
<p>
“Sour, aren’t they?” chuckled Heavy. “I
handed you a real one for fair, that time, didn’t
I, Madge?”
</p>
<p>
Then she tried to sidle through the narrow
opening, got stuck, and was urged on by Madge
pushing her. With a bang—punctuated by a
chorus of muffled exclamations from the girls
already assembled—she tore away the frame and
the blanket and got through.
</p>
<p>
“Shut the door, quick, guard!” exclaimed
Helen Cameron.
</p>
<p>
“Of course, that would be Heavy—entering
like a female Samson and tearing down the pillars
of the temple,” snapped Mercy Curtis, the
lame girl, in her sharp way.
</p>
<p>
“Please repair the damage, Helen,” said Ruth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4'></a>4</span>
Fielding, who presided at the far end of the
room, sitting cross-legged on one of the beds.
</p>
<p>
The other girls were arranged on the chairs,
or upon the floor before her. There was a goodly
number of them, and they now included most of
the members of the secret society known at Briarwood
Hall as the “S.&nbsp;B.’s.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth herself was a bright, brown-haired girl
who, without possessing many pretensions to real
beauty of feature, still was quite good to
look at and proved particularly charming when
one grew to know her well.
</p>
<p>
She was rather plump, happy of disposition,
and with the kindest heart in the world. She
made both friends and enemies. No person of
real character can escape being disliked, now and
then, by those of envious disposition.
</p>
<p>
Ruth Fielding succeeded, usually, in winning to
her those who at first disliked her. And this, I
claim, is a better gift than that of being universally
popular from the start.
</p>
<p>
Ruth had come from her old home in Darrowtown,
where her parents died, two years before,
to the Red Mill on the Lumano River, where her
great-uncle, Jabez Potter, the miller, was inclined
at first to shelter her only as an object of his
grudging charity. In the first volume of this
series, however, entitled “Ruth Fielding of the
Red Mill; Or, Jasper Parloe’s Secret,” the girl
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5'></a>5</span>
found her way—in a measure, at least—to the
uncle’s crabbed heart.
</p>
<p>
Uncle Jabez was a just man, and he considered
it his duty, when Helen Cameron, Ruth’s
dearest friend, was sent to Briarwood Hall to
school, to send Ruth to the same institution. In
the second volume, “Ruth Fielding at Briarwood
Hall; Or, Solving the Campus Mystery,” was
related the adventures, friendships, rivalries, and
fun of Ruth’s and Helen’s first term at the old
school.
</p>
<p>
In “Ruth Fielding at Snow Camp; Or, Lost
in the Backwoods,” was told the adventures of
Ruth and her friends at the Camerons’ winter
camp during the Christmas holidays. At the end
of the first year of school, they all went to the
seaside, to experience many adventures in “Ruth
Fielding at Lighthouse Point; Or, Nita, the Girl
Castaway,” the fourth volume of the series.
</p>
<p>
A part of that eventful summer was spent by
Ruth and her chums in Montana, and the girl of
the Red Mill was enabled to do old Uncle Jabez
such a favor that he willingly agreed to pay her
expenses at Briarwood Hall for another year.
This is all told in “Ruth Fielding at Silver Ranch;
Or, Schoolgirls Among the Cowboys.”
</p>
<p>
The girls returned to Briarwood Hall and in
the sixth volume of the series, entitled “Ruth
Fielding on Cliff Island; Or, The Old Hunter’s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6'></a>6</span>
Treasure Box,” Ruth was privileged to help Jerry
Sheming and his unfortunate old uncle in the
recovery of their title to Cliff Island in Lake
Tallahaska, while she and her friends had some
thrilling and many funny adventures during the
mid-winter vacation.
</p>
<p>
The second half of this school year was now
old. The Easter recess was past and the girls
were looking forward to the usual break-up in
the middle of June. The hardest of the work
for the year was over. Those girls who had been
faithful in their studies prior to Easter could
now take something of a breathing spell, and the
S.&nbsp;B.’s were determined to initiate such candidates
as had been on the waiting list for reception into
the secrets of the most popular society in the
school.
</p>
<p>
The shrouded door of the quartette room occupied
by Ruth, Helen, Mercy, and Jane Ann Hicks,
from Montana, was opened carefully again and
again until the outer guard, Madge Steele, had
admitted all the candidates and most of the members
of the S.&nbsp;B. order who were expected.
</p>
<p>
Each girl was presented with at least half a
big sour pickle from Heavy’s store; but really,
the pickles had nothing to do with the initiation
of the neophytes.
</p>
<p>
There was a serious and helpful side to the society
of the S.&nbsp;B.’s—as witness the password.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7'></a>7</span>
Ruth, who was the most active member of the
institution, realized, however, that the girls were
so full of fun that they must have some way of
expressing themselves out of the ordinary. Perhaps
she had asked Mademoiselle Picolet, the
French teacher, whose room was in this dormitory,
and Miss Scrimp, the matron, to overlook
this present infraction of the rules, for it must
be admitted that the retiring bell had rung half
an hour before the gathering in this particular
room.
</p>
<p>
“All here!” breathed Ruth, at last, and
Madge was called in. The candidates were
placed in the middle of the floor. Ann Hicks,
the girl from Silver Ranch, was one of these.
Ann had proved her character and made herself
popular in the school against considerable odds,
as related in the preceding volume. Now, the
honor of being admitted into the secret society
was added to the other marks of the school’s
approval.
</p>
<p>
“Candidates,” said Ruth, addressing in most
solemn tones the group of girls before her, “you
are about to be initiated into the degree of the
Marble Harp. As Infants, when you first entered
the school, you were all made acquainted
with the legend of the Marble Harp.
</p>
<p>
“The figure of <em>Harmony</em>, presiding over the
fountain in the middle of the campus, was modeled by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span>
the sculptor from the only daughter of
the man who originally owned Briarwood Park
before it became a school. Said sculptor and
daughter—in the most approved fashion of the
present day school of romanticist authors—ran
away with each other, were married without the
father’s approval, and both are supposed to have
died miserably in a studio-garret.
</p>
<p>
“The heart-broken father naturally left his
cur-r-r-se upon the fountain, and it is said—mind
you, this is hearsay,” added Ruth, solemnly,
“that whenever anything of moment is about to
transpire at Briarwood Hall, or any calamity befall,
the strings of the marble harp held in the
hands of <em>Harmony</em>, are heard to twang.
</p>
<p>
“Of course, as has been pointed out before,
the fact that the harp is in the shape of a <em>lyre</em>,
must be considered, too, if one is to accept this
legend. But, however, and nevertheless,” pursued
Ruth, “it has been decided that the candidates
here assembled must join in the Mackintosh
March, and, in procession, led by our Outer
Guard and followed—not to say <em>herded</em>—by our
Rear Guard, must proceed once around the campus,
down into the garden, and circle the fountain,
chanting, as you have been instructed, the
marching song.
</p>
<p>
“All ready! You all have your mackintoshes,
as instructed? Into them at once,” commanded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span>
Ruth. “Into line—one after the other. Now,
Outer Guard!”
</p>
<p>
The lights were extinguished; the blanket
at the door was removed; Madge Steele led
the way and Heavy, as the Rear Guard, was
last in the line. Shrouded in the hoods of the
mackintoshes, scarcely one of the girls would have
been recognized by any curious teacher or matron.
</p>
<p>
Ruth hopped down from the bed, and the remaining
Sweetbriars ran giggling to the windows.
It was a drizzly, dark night. The paths about
the campus glistened, and the lamps upon the
posts flickered dimly.
</p>
<p>
Out of the front door filed the procession;
when they were far enough away from the buildings
which surrounded the campus, they began
the chant, based upon Tom Moore’s famous old
song:
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The&nbsp;&nbsp;harp&nbsp;&nbsp;that&nbsp;&nbsp;once&nbsp;&nbsp;through&nbsp;&nbsp;Briarwood&nbsp;&nbsp;Hall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;soul&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;music&nbsp;&nbsp;shed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now&nbsp;&nbsp;hangs&nbsp;&nbsp;as&nbsp;&nbsp;mute&nbsp;&nbsp;o’er&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;campus&nbsp;&nbsp;fount<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As&nbsp;&nbsp;though&nbsp;&nbsp;that&nbsp;&nbsp;soul&nbsp;&nbsp;were&nbsp;&nbsp;dead.”<br />
</p>
<p>
Madge Steele, with her strong voice, led the
chant. The girls, crowded at the open windows,
began to giggle, for they could hear Heavy, at
the end of the procession, sing out a very different
verse.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span>
</p>
<p>
“That rascal ought to be fined for that,” murmured
The Fox, the sandy-haired girl next to
Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“But, isn’t she funny?” gasped Helen, on the
other side of the Chief of the S.&nbsp;B.’s.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear!” exclaimed Belle Tingley. “I
hope Sarah Fish got there ahead of them. <em>Won’t</em>
they be surprised when they get a baptism of a
glass of water each from the fountain, as they
go by?”
</p>
<p>
“They’ll think the statue has come to life, sure
enough, if it doesn’t twang the lyre,” quoth Helen.
</p>
<p>
“They’ll get an unexpected ducking,” giggled
Lluella Fairfax.
</p>
<p>
“It won’t hurt them,” Ruth said, placidly.
“That’s why I insisted upon the mackintoshes.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s just as dark down there by the fountain
as it can be,” spoke Helen, with a little shiver.
“D’you remember, Ruthie, how they hazed us
there when we were Infants?”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t I!” agreed her chum.
</p>
<p>
“If Sarah is careful, she can stand right up
there against the statue and never be seen, while
she can reach the water to throw it at the girls
easily. There!” cried Belle. “They’re turning
down the walk to the steps. I can see them.”
</p>
<p>
They all could see them—dimly. Like shadows
the procession descended to the marble fountain,
still chanting softly the refrain of the marching song.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>
Suddenly a shriek—a very vigorous
and startling sound—rang out across the campus.
</p>
<p>
“It’s begun!” giggled Belle.
</p>
<p>
But the sound was repeated—then in a thrilling
chorus. Ruth was startled. She exclaimed:
</p>
<p>
“That wasn’t either of the candidates. It was
Sarah who screamed. There! It is Sarah again.
Something has happened!”
</p>
<p>
Something certainly had happened. There had
been an unexpected fault somewhere in the initiation.
The procession burst like a bombshell, and
the girls scattered through the wet campus, utterly
terrified, and screaming as they ran.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span><a name='chII' id='chII'></a>CHAPTER II—THE WILD GIRL</h2>
<p>
“Something awful must have occurred!”
cried Helen Cameron.
</p>
<p>
Ruth did not remain at the window for more
than a moment after seeing the girls engaged in
the initiation disperse, and hearing their screams.
She drew back from the crowding group and
darted out of the room. Fortunately neither the
French teacher, nor the matron, had yet been
aroused. If the girls came noisily into the dormitory
building, Ruth knew very well that “the
powers that be” must of necessity take cognizance
of the infraction of the rules.
</p>
<p>
The girl from the Red Mill sped down the
broad stairway and out of the house. Some of
the fastest runners among the frightened girls
were already panting at the steps.
</p>
<p>
“Hush! hush!” commanded Ruth. “What
is the matter? What has happened?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! it’s the ghost!” declared one girl.
</p>
<p>
“So’s your grandmother’s aunt!” snapped another.
“Somebody shoved Sarah into the water.
It was no ghost.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>
</p>
<p>
It was Madge Steele who last spoke, and
Ruth seized upon the senior, believing she might
get something like a sensible explanation from
her.
</p>
<p>
“You girls go into the house quietly,” warned
Ruth, as they scrambled up the stone steps.
“Don’t you <em>dare</em> make a noise and get us all into
trouble.”
</p>
<p>
Then she turned upon Madge, begging: “Do,
<em>do</em> tell me what you mean, Madge Steele. <em>Who</em>
pushed Sarah?”
</p>
<p>
“That’s what I can’t tell you. But I heard
Sarah yelling that she was pushed, and she did
most certainly fall right into the fountain when
she climbed up there beside the statue.”
</p>
<p>
“What a ridiculous thing!” giggled Ruth.
“Somebody played a trick on her. I guess she
was fooled instead of the candidates being startled,
eh?”
</p>
<p>
“I saw somebody—or something—drop off
the other side of the fountain and run—I saw it
myself,” declared Madge.
</p>
<p>
“Here comes Sarah,” cried Ruth, under her
breath. “And I declare she <em>is</em> all wet!”
</p>
<p>
Sarah Fish was actually laughing, but in a
hysterical way.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear me! was ever anything so ridiculous
before?” she gasped.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>
</p>
<p>
“Hush! Don’t get Miss Picolet after us,”
begged Madge.
</p>
<p>
“What really happened?” demanded Ruth,
eagerly.
</p>
<p>
“Why—I’ll tell you,” replied Sarah, whose
gown clung to her as though it had been pasted
upon her figure. “See? I’m just <em>soaked</em>. Talk
about sprinkling those silly lambs of candidates!
Why, <em>I</em> was immersed—you see.”
</p>
<p>
“But how?”
</p>
<p>
“I slipped over there before the procession
started from these steps. I was watching the
girls, and listening to them sing, and didn’t pay
much attention to anything else.
</p>
<p>
“But when I dodged down into the little garden,
I thought I heard a footstep on the flags. I
looked all around, and saw nothing. Now I
know the person must have already climbed up
on the fountain and gotten into the shadow of
the statue—just as I wanted to do.”
</p>
<p>
“Was there really somebody there?” demanded
Madge.
</p>
<p>
“How do you think I got into the fountain, if
not?” snapped Sarah Fish.
</p>
<p>
“Fell in.”
</p>
<p>
“I did not!” cried Sarah. “I was pushed.”
</p>
<p>
“‘Did She Fall, or Was She Pushed?’” giggled
Madge. “Sounds like a moving picture
title.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>
</p>
<p>
“You can laugh,” scoffed Sarah. “I wonder
what you’d have done?”
</p>
<p>
“Got just as wet as you did, most likely,” said
Ruth, calming the troubled waters. “Do go on,
Sarah. So you really <em>saw</em> somebody?”
</p>
<p>
“And felt somebody. When I climbed up to
get a footing beside the sitting figure, so that the
girls would not see me, somebody shoved me—with
both hands—right into the fountain.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s when you squalled?” asked Madge.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, indeed! And I rolled out of the fountain
just as the—the person who pushed me,
tumbled down off the pedestal and ran.”
</p>
<p>
“For pity’s sake!” ejaculated Ruth. “Do tell
us who it was, Sarah.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you think I would if I could?” responded
Sarah, trying to wring the water out of
her narrow skirt.
</p>
<p>
Through the gloom appeared another figure—the
too, too solid figure of Jennie Stone.
</p>
<p>
“Oh—dear—me! Oh—dear—me!” she
panted. And then seeing Sarah Fish dripping
there on the walk, Heavy fell upon the steps and
giggled. “Oh, Sarah!” she gasped. “For once,
your appearance fits your name, all right. You
look like a fish out of its element.”
</p>
<p>
“Laugh——”
</p>
<p>
“I have to,” responded Heavy.
</p>
<p>
“Well, if it were you——”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>
</p>
<p>
“I know. I’d be floundering there in the water
yet.”
</p>
<p>
“But tell me!” cried Ruth, under her breath.
“Was it a girl who pushed you into the fountain,
Sarah?”
</p>
<p>
“It wore skirts—I’m sure of that, at least,”
grumbled Sarah.
</p>
<p>
“But it ran faster than any girl I ever saw
run,” vouchsafed Heavy. “<em>Did</em> you see her just
skimming across the campus toward the main
building? Like the wind!”
</p>
<p>
“It must be one of our girls,” declared Madge.
</p>
<p>
“All right,” said Heavy. “But if so, it’s a
girl I never saw run before. You can’t tell me.”
</p>
<p>
“You had better go in and get off your clothes,
Sarah,” advised Ruth. Then she looked at
Madge. Madge was one of the oldest girls at
Briarwood. “Let’s go and see if we can find
the girl,” Ruth suggested.
</p>
<p>
“I’m game,” cried Madge, as the other stragglers
mounted the steps and disappeared behind
the dormitory building door.
</p>
<p>
Both girls hurried down the walk under the
trees to the main building. In one end of this
Mrs. Tellingham and the Doctor had their abode.
In the other end was the dining-room, with the
kitchens and other offices in the basement. Besides,
Tony Foyle, who was chief man-of-all-work
about the Hall, and his wife, who was cook,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>
had their living rooms in the basement of this
building.
</p>
<p>
Ruth and Madge hoped to investigate the matter
of the mysterious marauder without arousing
the little old Irishman, but already they saw his
lantern behind the grated window in the front
basement, and, as the two girls came nearer, they
heard him grumblingly unchain the door.
</p>
<p>
“Bad ‘cess to ’em! I seen ’em cavortin’ across
the campus, I tell ye, Mary Ann! There’s wan
of thim down here in the airy——”
</p>
<p>
It was evident that the old couple had been
aroused, and that Tony was talking to his wife,
who remained in the bedchamber. Ruth seized
Madge’s wrist and whispered in her ear:
</p>
<p>
“You run around one way, and I’ll go the
other. There must be <em>somebody</em> about, for Tony
saw her——”
</p>
<p>
“If it <em>is</em> a girl.”
</p>
<p>
“Both Sarah and Heavy say it is. I’m not
afraid,” declared Ruth, and she started off alone
at once.
</p>
<p>
Madge disappeared around the corner. Ruth
had darted into the heavily shaded space between
the end of the main building and the next
brick structure. There were no lights here, but
there was a gas lamp on a post beyond the far
corner, and before she was half way to it, she saw
a shadow flit across the illuminated space about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>
this post, and disappear behind a clump of snowball
bushes.
</p>
<p>
Ruth ran swiftly forward, dodged around the
other end of the clump of thick bushes, and suddenly
collided with somebody who uttered a muffled
scream. Ruth grabbed the girl by both
shoulders and held on.
</p>
<p>
It was like trying to hold a wildcat. The girl,
who was considerably smaller, and far slighter
than Ruth, struggled madly to escape. She did
not say a word at first, only straining to get away
from Ruth’s strong grip.
</p>
<p>
“Now stop! now wait!” panted Ruth. “I
want to know who you are——”
</p>
<p>
The other tugged her best, but the girl of the
Red Mill was very strong for her age, and she
held on.
</p>
<p>
“Stop!” panted Ruth again. “If you make
a noise, you’ll bring old Tony here—and then you
<em>will</em> be in trouble. I want to know who you are
and what you were doing down there at the fountain—and
why you pushed Sarah into the water?”
</p>
<p>
“And I’d like to push <em>you</em> in!” ejaculated the
other girl, suddenly. “You let go of me, or I’ll
scratch you!”
</p>
<p>
“You can’t,” replied Ruth, firmly. “I’m holding
you too tight.”
</p>
<p>
“Then I’ll bite you!” vowed the other.
</p>
<p>
“Why—you’re a regular wild girl,” exclaimed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>
Ruth. “You stop struggling, or I’ll shout for
help, and then Tony will come running.”
</p>
<p>
“D—don’t give me away,” gasped the
strange girl, suddenly ceasing her struggles.
</p>
<p>
“Do you belong here?” demanded Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Belong here? Naw! I don’t belong nowheres.
An’ you better lemme go, Miss.”
</p>
<p>
“Why—you <em>are</em> a strange girl,” said Ruth,
greatly amazed. “You can’t be one of us Briarwoods.”
</p>
<p>
“That ain’t my name a-tall,” whispered the
frightened girl. “My name’s Raby.”
</p>
<p>
“But what were you doing over there at the
fountain?”
</p>
<p>
“Gettin’ a drink. Was <em>that</em> any harm?” demanded
the girl, sharply. “I’d found some dry
pieces of bread the cook had put on top of a
box there by the back door. I reckoned she
didn’t want the bread, and <em>I</em> did.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear me!” whispered Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“And dry bread’s dry eatin’,” said the strange
girl. “I had ter have a drink o’ water to wash
it down. And jest as I got down into that little
place where I seed the fountain this afternoon——”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my, dear!” gasped Ruth. “Have you
been lurking about the school all that time and
never came and asked good old Mary Ann for
something decent to eat?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>
</p>
<p>
“Huh! mebbe she’d a drove me off. Or mebbe
she’d done worse to me,” said the other, quickly.
“They beat me again day ’fore yesterday——”
</p>
<p>
“Who beat you?” demanded Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Them Perkinses. Now! don’t you go for to
tell I said that. I don’t want to go back to ’em—and
their house ain’t such a fur ways from here.
If that cook—or any other grown folk—seen
me, they’d want to send me back. I know ’em!”
exclaimed the girl, bitterly. “But mebbe you’ll
be decent about it, and keep your mouth shut.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! I won’t tell a soul,” murmured Ruth.
“But I’m so sorry. Only dry bread and
water—”
</p>
<p>
“Huh! it’ll keep a feller alive,” said this
strangely spoken girl. “I ain’t no softie. Now,
you lemme go, will yer? My! but you <em>are</em>
strong.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll let you go. But I do want to help you.
I want to know more about you—<em>all</em> about you.
But if Tony comes——”
</p>
<p>
“That’s his lantern. I see it. He’s a-comin’,”
gasped the other, trying to wriggle free.
</p>
<p>
“Where will you stay to-night?” asked Ruth,
anxiously.
</p>
<p>
“I gotter place. It’s warm and dry. I stayed
there las’ night. Come! you lemme go.”
</p>
<p>
“But I want to help you——”
</p>
<p>
“‘Twon’t help me none to git me cotched.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I know it! Wait! Meet me somewhere
near here to-morrow morning—will you? I’ll
bring some money with me. I’ll help you.”
</p>
<p>
“Say! ain’t you foolin’?” demanded the other,
seemingly startled by the fact that Ruth wished
to help her.
</p>
<p>
“No. I speak the truth. I will help you.”
</p>
<p>
“Then I’ll meet you—but you won’t tell nobody?”
</p>
<p>
“Not a soul?”
</p>
<p>
“Cross yer heart?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t do such foolish things,” said Ruth.
“If I say I’ll do a thing, I will do it.”
</p>
<p>
“All right. What time’ll I see you?”
</p>
<p>
“Ten o’clock.”
</p>
<p>
“Aw-right,” agreed the strange girl. “I’ll be
across the road from that path that’s bordered
by them cedar trees——”
</p>
<p>
“The Cedar Walk?”
</p>
<p>
“Guess so.”
</p>
<p>
“I shall be there. And will you?”
</p>
<p>
“Huh! I kin keep my word as well as you
kin,” said the girl, sharply. Then she suddenly
broke away from Ruth and ran. Tony Foyle
came blundering around the corner of the house
and Ruth, much excited, slipped away from the
brush clump and ran as fast as she could to meet
Madge Steele.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! is that you, Ruth?” exclaimed the senior,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>
when Ruth ran into her arms. “Tony’s out.
We had better go back to bed, or he’ll report us
to Mrs. Tellingham in the morning. I don’t
know where the strange girl could have gone.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth did not say a word. Madge did not ask
her, and the girl of the Red Mill allowed her
friend to think that her own search had been
quite as unsuccessful. But, as Ruth looked at it,
it was not <em>her</em> secret.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span><a name='chIII' id='chIII'></a>CHAPTER III—SADIE RABY’S STORY</h2>
<p>
Ruth did not sleep at all well that night.
Luckily, Helen had nothing on <em>her</em> mind or conscience,
or she must have been disturbed by Ruth’s
tossing and wakefulness. The other two girls
in the big quartette room—Mercy Curtis and
Ann Hicks—were likewise unaware of Ruth’s
restlessness.
</p>
<p>
The girl of the Red Mill felt that she could
take nobody into her confidence regarding the
strange girl who said her name was Raby. Perhaps
Ruth had no right to aid the girl if she was
a runaway; yet there must be some very strong
reason for making a girl prefer practical starvation
to the shelter of “them Perkinses.”
</p>
<p>
Bread and water! The thought of the child
being so hungry that she had eaten discarded,
dry bread, washed down with water from the
fountain in the campus, brought tears to Ruth’s
eyes.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! I wish I knew what was best to do
for her,” thought Ruth. “Should I tell Mrs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>
Tellingham? Or, mightn’t I get some of the
girls interested in her? Dear Helen has plenty
of money, and she is just as tender-hearted as
she can be.”
</p>
<p>
Yet Ruth had given her promise to take nobody
into her confidence about the half-wild girl;
and, with Ruth Fielding, “a promise was a
promise!”
</p>
<p>
In the morning, there was soon a buzz of excitement
all over the school regarding the strange
happening at the fountain on the campus. One
girl whispered it to another, and the tale spread
like wildfire. However, the teachers and the
principal did not hear of the affair.
</p>
<p>
Ruth’s lips, she decided, were sealed for the
present regarding the mysterious girl who had
pushed Sarah Fish into what Heavy declared
was “her proper element.” The wildest and most
improbable stories and suspicions were circulated
before assembly hour, regarding the Unknown.
</p>
<p>
There was so much said, and so many questions
asked, in the quartette room where Ruth was located,
that she felt like running away herself.
But at mail time Madge Steele burst into the
dormitory “charged to the muzzle,” as The Fox
expressed it, with a new topic of conversation.
</p>
<p>
“What do you think, girls? Oh! what do
you think?” she cried. “We’re going to live
at Sunrise Farm.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>
</p>
<p>
“Ha! you ask us a question and answer it in
the same breath,” said Mercy, with a snap. “Now
you’ve spilled the beans and we don’t care anything
about it at all.”
</p>
<p>
“You <em>do</em> care,” declared Madge. “I ask <em>you</em>
first of all, Mercy. I invite every one of you for
the last week in June and the first two weeks of
July at Sunrise Farm——”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, wait!” exclaimed Mary Cox, otherwise
“The Fox.” “Do begin at the beginning. I,
for one, never heard of Sunrise Farm before.”
</p>
<p>
“I—I believe <em>I</em> have,” said Ruth slowly. “But
I don’t suppose it can be the same farm Madge
means. It is a big stock farm and it’s not many
miles from Darrowtown where I—I used to live
once. <em>That</em> farm belonged to a family named
Benson——”
</p>
<p>
“And a family named Steele owns it now,”
put in Madge, promptly. “It’s the very same
farm. It’s a big place—five hundred acres. It’s
on a big, flat-topped hill. Father has been negotiating
for the other farms around about, and
has gotten options on most of them, too. He’s
been doing it very quietly.
</p>
<p>
“Now he says that the old house on the main
farm is in good enough shape for us to live there
this summer, while he builds a bigger house.
And you shall all come with us—all you eight
girls—the Brilliant Octette of Briarwood Hall.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>
</p>
<p>
“And Bob will get Helen’s brother, and Busy
Izzy; and Belle shall invite her brothers if she
likes, and——”
</p>
<p>
“Say! are you figuring on having a standing
army there?” demanded Mercy.
</p>
<p>
“That’s all right. There is room. The old
garret has been made over into two great dormitories——”
</p>
<p>
“And you’ve been keeping all this to yourself,
Madge Steele?” cried Helen. “What a nice
girl you are. It sounds lovely.”
</p>
<p>
“And your mother and father will wish we
had never arrived, after we’ve been there two
days,” declared Heavy. “By the way, do they
know I eat three square meals each day?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. And that if you are hungry, you get up
in your sleep and find the pantry,” giggled The
Fox.
</p>
<p>
“Might as well have all the important details
understood right at the start,” said Heavy, firmly.
</p>
<p>
“If you’ll all say you’ll come,” said Madge,
smiling broadly, “we’ll just have the lov-li-est
time!”
</p>
<p>
“But we’ll have to write home for permission,”
Lluella Fairfax ventured.
</p>
<p>
“Of course we shall,” chimed in Helen.
</p>
<p>
“Then do so at once,” commanded the senior.
“You see, this will be my graduation party. No
more Briarwood for me after this June, and I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>
don’t know what I shall do when I go to Poughkeepsie
next fall and leave all you ‘Infants’ behind
here——”
</p>
<p>
“<em>Infants!</em> Listen to her!” shouted Belle
Tingley. “Get out of here!” and under a shower
of sofa pillows Madge Steele had to retire from
the room.
</p>
<p>
Ruth slipped away easily after that, for the
other girls were gabbling so fast over the invitation
for the early summer vacation, that they
did not notice her departure.
</p>
<p>
This was the hour she had promised to meet
the strange girl in whom she had taken such a
great interest the night before—it was between
the two morning recitation hours.
</p>
<p>
She ran down past the end of the dormitory
building into the head of the long serpentine path,
known as the Cedar Walk. The lines of closely
growing cedars sheltered her from observation
from any of the girls’ windows.
</p>
<p>
The great bell in the clock tower boomed out
ten strokes as Ruth reached the muddy road at
the end of the walk. Nobody was in sight. Ruth
looked up and down. Then she walked a little
way in both directions to see if the girl she had
come to meet was approaching.
</p>
<p>
“I—I am afraid she isn’t going to keep her
word,” thought Ruth. “And yet—somehow—she
seemed so frank and honest——”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>
</p>
<p>
She heard a shrill, but low whistle, and the
sound made her start and turn. She faced a
thicket of scrubby bushes across the road. Suddenly
she saw a face appear from behind this
screen—a girl’s face.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! Is it you?” cried Ruth, starting in
that direction.
</p>
<p>
“Cheese it! don’t yell it out. Somebody’ll hear
you,” said the girl, hoarsely.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear me! you have a dreadful cold,”
urged Ruth, darting around the clump of brush
and coming face to face with the strange girl.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, <em>that</em> don’t give me so much worry,” said
the Raby girl. “Aw—My goodness! Is that for
<em>me</em>?”
</p>
<p>
Ruth had unfolded a paper covered parcel she
carried. There were sandwiches, two apples, a
piece of cake, and half a box of chocolate candies.
Ruth had obtained these supplies with some difficulty.
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t suppose you would have any breakfast,”
said Ruth, softly. “You sit right down on
that dry log and eat. Don’t mind me. I—I was
awake most all night worrying about you being
out here, hungry and alone.”
</p>
<p>
The girl had begun to eat ravenously, and now,
with her mouth full, she gazed up at her new
friend’s face with a suddenness that made Ruth
pause.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>
</p>
<p>
“Say!” said the girl, with difficulty. “You’re
all right. I seen you come down the path alone,
but reckoned I’d better wait and see if you didn’t
have somebody follerin’ on behind. Ye might
have give me away.”
</p>
<p>
“Why! I told you I would tell nobody.”
</p>
<p>
“Aw, yes—I know. Mebbe I’d oughter have
believed ye; but I dunno. Lots of folks has
fooled me. Them Perkinses was as soft as butter
when they came to take me away from the orphanage.
But now they treat me as mean as dirt—yes,
they do!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear me! So you haven’t any mother
or father?”
</p>
<p>
“Not a one,” confessed the other. “Didn’t I
tell you I was took from an orphanage? Willie
and Dickie was taken away by other folks. I
wisht somebody would ha’ taken us all three together;
but I’m mighty glad them Perkinses
didn’t git the kids.”
</p>
<p>
She sighed with present contentment, and wiped
her fingers on her skirt. For some moments Ruth
had remained silent, listening to her. Now she
had for the first time the opportunity of examining
the strange girl.
</p>
<p>
It had been too dark for her to see much of
her the night before. Now the light of day revealed
a very unkempt and not at all attractive
figure. She might have been twelve—possibly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>
fourteen. She was slight for her age, but she
might be stronger than she appeared to Ruth.
Certainly she was vigorous enough.
</p>
<p>
She had black hair which was in a dreadful
tangle. Her complexion was naturally dark, and
she had a deep layer of tan, and over that quite
a thick layer of dirt. Her hands and wrists were
stained and dirty, too.
</p>
<p>
She wore no hat, raw as the weather was. Her
ragged dress was an old faded gingham; over it
she wore a three-quarter length coat of some
indeterminate, shoddy material, much soiled, and
shapeless as a mealsack. Her shoes and stockings
were in keeping with the rest of her outfit.
</p>
<p>
Altogether her appearance touched Ruth Fielding
deeply. This Raby girl was an orphan. Ruth
remembered keenly the time when the loss of her
own parents was still a fresh wound. Supposing
no kind friends had been raised up for her? Suppose
there had been no Red Mill for her to go
to? She might have been much the same sort of
castaway as this.
</p>
<p>
“Tell me who you are—tell me all about
yourself—do!” begged the girl of the Red Mill,
sitting down beside the other on the log. “I
am an orphan as well as you, my dear. Really,
I am.”
</p>
<p>
“Was you in the orphanage?” demanded the
Raby girl, quickly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no. I had friends——”
</p>
<p>
“You warn’t never a reg’lar orphan, then,”
was the sharp response.
</p>
<p>
“Tell me about it,” urged Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Me an’ the kids was taken to the orphanage
just as soon as Mom died,” said the girl, in quite
a matter-of-fact manner. “Pa died two months
before. It was sudden. But Mom had been sickly
for a long time—I can remember. I was six.”
</p>
<p>
“And how old are you now?” asked Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Twelve and a half. They puts us out to work
at twelve anyhow, so them Perkinses got me,”
explained the child. “I was pretty sharp and
foxy when we went to the orphanage. The kids
was only two and a half——”
</p>
<p>
“Both of them?” cried Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Yep. They’re twins, Willie and Dickie is.
An’ awful smart—an’ pretty before they lopped
off their curls at the orphanage. I was glad Mom
was dead then,” said the girl, nodding. “She’d
been heart-broke to see ’em at first without their
long curls.
</p>
<p>
“I dunno now—not rightly—just what’s become
of ’em,” went on the girl. “Mebbe they
come back to the orphanage. The folks that took
’em was nice enough, I guess, but the man thought
two boys would be too much for his wife to take
care of. She was a weakly lookin’ critter.
</p>
<p>
“But the matron always said they shouldn’t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>
go away for keeps, unless they went together.
My goodness me! they’d never be happy apart,”
said the strange girl, wagging her head confidentially.
“And they’re only nine now. There’s
three years yet for the matron to find them a good
home. Ye see, folks take young orphans on trial.
I wisht them Perkinses had taken <em>me</em> on trial and
then had sent me back. Or, I wisht they’d let the
orphans take folks on trial instead of the other
way ’round.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, it must be very hard!” murmured Ruth.
“And you and your little brothers had to be separated?’
</p>
<p>
“Yep. And Willie and Dickie liked their sister
Sade a heap,” and the girl suddenly
“knuckled” her eyes with her dirty hand to wipe
away the tears. “Huh! I’m a big baby, ain’t I?
Well! that’s how it is.”
</p>
<p>
“And you really have run away from the people
that took you from the orphanage, Sadie?”
</p>
<p>
“Betcher! So would you. Mis’ Perkins is
awful cross, an’ he’s crosser! I got enough——”
</p>
<p>
“Wouldn’t they take you back at the orphanage?”
</p>
<p>
“Nope. No runaways there. I’ve seen other
girls come back and they made ’em go right away
again with the same folks. You see, there’s a
Board, or sumpin’; an’ the Board finds out all
about the folks that take away the orphans in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>
first place. Then they won’t never own up that
they was fooled, that Board won’t. They allus
say it’s the kids’ fault if they ain’t suited.”
</p>
<p>
Suddenly the girl jumped up and peered through
the bushes. Ruth had heard the thumping of
horses’ hoofs on the wet road.
</p>
<p>
“My goodness!” gasped Sadie Raby.
“Here’s ol’ Perkins hisself. He’s come clean
over this road to look for me. Don’t you tell
him——”
</p>
<p>
She seized Ruth’s wrist with her claw-like little
hand.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you be afraid,” said Ruth. “And take
this.” She thrust a closely-folded dollar bill into
the girl’s grimy fingers. “I wish it was more. I’ll
come here again to-morrow——”
</p>
<p>
The other had darted into the woods ere she
had ceased speaking. Somebody shouted
“Whoa!” in a very harsh voice, and then a
heavy pair of cowhide boots landed solidly in
the road.
</p>
<p>
“I see ye, ye little witch!” exclaimed the harsh
voice. “Come out o’ there before I tan ye with
this whip!” and the whip in question snapped
viciously as the speaker pounded violently through
the clump of bushes, right upon the startled Ruth.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span><a name='chIV' id='chIV'></a>CHAPTER IV—“THEM PERKINSES”</h2>
<p>
It was a fact that Ruth crouched back behind
the log, fearful of the wrathful farmer. He was
a big, coarse, high-booted, red-faced man, and
he swung and snapped the blacksnake whip he
carried as though he really intended using the
cruel instrument upon the tender body of the girl,
whose figure he had evidently seen dimly through
the bushes.
</p>
<p>
“Come out ’o that!” he bawled, striding toward
the log, and making the whiplash whistle
once more in the air.
</p>
<p>
Ruth leaped up, screaming with fear. “Don’t
you touch me, sir! Don’t you dare!” she cried,
and ran around the bushes out in to the road.
</p>
<p>
The blundering farmer followed her, still snapping
the whip. Perhaps he had been drinking; at
least, it was certain he was too angry to see the
girl very well until they were both in the road.
</p>
<p>
Then he halted, and added:
</p>
<p>
“I’ll be whipsawed if that’s the gal!”
</p>
<p>
“I am <em>not</em> the girl—not the girl you want—poor
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>
thing!” gasped Ruth. “Oh! you are horrid—terrible——”
</p>
<p>
“Shut up, ye little fool!” exclaimed the man,
harshly. “You know where Sade is, then, I’ll be
bound.”
</p>
<p>
“How do you know——?”
</p>
<p>
“Ha! ye jest the same as told me,” he returned,
grinning suddenly and again snapping the whip.
“You can tell me where that runaway’s gone.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know. Even if I did, I would not tell
you, sir,” declared Ruth, recovering some of her
natural courage now.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t ye sass me—nor don’t ye lie to me,”
and this time he swung the cruel whip, until the
long lash whipped around her skirts about at a
level with her knees. It did not hurt her, but Ruth
cringed and shrieked aloud again.
</p>
<p>
“Stop yer howling!” commanded Perkins.
“Tell me about Sade Raby. Where’s she gone?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know.”
</p>
<p>
“Warn’t she right there in them bushes with
you?”
</p>
<p>
“I shan’t tell you anything more,” declared
Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Ye won’t?”
</p>
<p>
The brute swung the blacksnake—this time in
earnest. It cracked, and then the snapper laid
along the girl’s forearm as though it were seared
with a hot iron.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>
</p>
<p>
Ruth shrieked again. The pain was more
than she could bear in silence. She turned to
flee up the Cedar Walk, but Perkins shouted at
her to stand.
</p>
<p>
“You try ter run, my beauty, and I’ll cut ye
worse than that,” he promised. “You tell me
about Sade Raby.”
</p>
<p>
Suddenly there came a hail, and Ruth turned
in hope of assistance. Old Dolliver’s stage came
tearing along the road, his bony horses at a hand-gallop.
The old man, whom the girls of Briarwood
Hall called “Uncle Noah,” brought his
horses—and the Ark—to a sudden halt.
</p>
<p>
“What yer doin’ to that gal, Sim Perkins?”
the old man demanded.
</p>
<p>
“What’s that to you, Dolliver?”
</p>
<p>
“You’ll find out mighty quick. Git out o’ here
or you’ll git into trouble. Did he hurt you, Miss
Ruth?”
</p>
<p>
“No-o—not much,” stammered Ruth, who desired
nothing so much as to get way from
the awful Mr. Perkins. Poor Sadie Raby! No
wonder she had been forced to run away from
“them Perkinses.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll see you jailed yet, Sim, for some of your
meanness,” said the old stage driver. “And you’ll
git there quick if you bother Mis’ Tellingham’s
gals——”
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t know she was one ‘o them tony school
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>
gals,” growled Perkins, getting aboard his wagon
again.
</p>
<p>
“Well, she is—an’ one ‘o the best of the lot,”
said Dolliver, and he smiled comfortably at
Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Huh! whad-she wanter be in comp’ny of that
brat ’o mine, then?” demanded Perkins, gathering
up his reins.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! are you hunting that orphanage gal ye
took to raise? I heard she couldn’t stand you
and Ma Perkins no longer,” Dolliver said, with
sarcasm.
</p>
<p>
“Never you mind. I’ll git her,” said Perkins,
and whipped up his horses.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear, me!” cried Ruth, when he had
gone. “What a terrible man, Mr. Dolliver.”
</p>
<p>
“Yah!” scoffed the old driver. “Jest a bag
of wind. Mean as can be, but a big coward.
Meanes’ folks around here, them Perkinses air.”
</p>
<p>
“But why were they allowed to have that poor
girl, then?” demanded Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“They went a-fur off to git her. Clean to Harburg.
Nobody knowed ’em there, I s’pose. Why,
Ma Perkins kin act like butter wouldn’t melt in
her mouth, if she wants to. But I sartainly am
sorry for that poor little Sade Raby, as they call
her.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! I do pity her so,” said Ruth, sadly.
</p>
<p>
The old man’s eyes twinkled. Old Dolliver
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>
was sly! “Then ye <em>do</em> know suthin’ about Sade—jes’
as Perkins said?”
</p>
<p>
“She was here just now. I gave her something
to eat—and a little money. You won’t tell, Mr.
Dolliver?”
</p>
<p>
“Huh! No. But dunno’s ye’d oughter helped
a runaway. That’s agin’ the law, ye see.”
</p>
<p>
“Would the law give that poor girl back to
those ugly people?”
</p>
<p>
“I s’pect so,” said Dolliver, scratching his
head. “Ye see, Sim Perkins an’ his wife air folks
ye can’t really go agin’—not <em>much</em>. Sim owns a
good farm, an’ pays his taxes, an’ ain’t a bad
neighbor. But they’ve had trouble before naow
with orphans. But before, ’twas boys.”
</p>
<p>
“I just hope they all ran away!” cried Ruth,
with emphasis.
</p>
<p>
“Wal—they did, by golly!” ejaculated the
stage driver, preparing to drive on.
</p>
<p>
“And if you see this poor girl, you won’t tell
anybody, will you, Mr. Dolliver?” pleaded Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“I jes’ sha’n’t see her,” said the man, his little
eyes twinkling. “But you take my advice, Miss
Fielding—don’t <em>you</em> see her, nuther!”
</p>
<p>
Ruth ran back to the school then—it was time.
She could not think of her lessons properly because
of her pity for Sadie Raby. Suppose that
horrid man should find the poor girl!
</p>
<p>
Every time Ruth saw the red welt on her arm,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>
where the whiplash had touched her, she wondered
how many times Perkins had lashed Sadie
when he was angry. It was a dreadful thought.
</p>
<p>
Although she had promised Sadie to keep her
secret, Ruth wondered if she might not do the
girl some good by telling Mrs. Tellingham about
her. Ruth was not afraid of the dignified principal
of Briarwood Hall—she knew too well Mrs.
Grace Tellingham’s good heart.
</p>
<p>
She determined at least that if Sadie appeared
at the end of the Cedar Walk the next day she
would try to get the runaway girl to go with her
to the principal’s office. Surely the girl should
not run wild in the woods and live any way and
how she could—especially so early in the season,
for there was still frost at night.
</p>
<p>
When Ruth ran down the long walk between
the cedar trees the next forenoon at ten, there
was nobody peering through the bushes where
Sadie Raby had watched the day before. Ruth
went up and down the road, into the woods a
little way, too—and called, and called. No reply.
Nothing answered but a chattering squirrel and
a jay who seemed to object to any human being
disturbing the usual tenor of the woods’ life
thereabout.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps she’ll come this afternoon,” thought
Ruth, and she hid the package of food she had
brought, and went back to her classes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span>
</p>
<p>
In the afternoon she had no better luck. The
runaway did not appear. The food had not been
touched. Ruth left the packet, hoping sadly that
the girl might find it.
</p>
<p>
The next morning she went again. She even
got up an hour earlier than usual and slipped out
ahead of the other girls. The food had been disturbed—oh,
yes! But by a dog or some “varmint.”
Sadie had not been to the rendezvous.
</p>
<p>
Hoping against hope, Ruth Fielding tacked a
note in an envelope to the log on which she and
Sadie had sat side by side. That was all she
could do, save to go each day for a time to see
if the strange girl had found the note.
</p>
<p>
There came a rain and the letter was turned
to pulp. Then Ruth Fielding gave up hope of
ever seeing Sadie Raby again. Old Dolliver told
her that the orphan had never returned to “them
Perkinses.” For this Ruth might be thankful, if
for nothing more.
</p>
<p>
The busy days and weeks passed. All the girls
of Ruth’s clique were writing back and forth to
their homes to arrange for the visit they expected
to make to Madge Steele’s summer home—Sunrise
Farm. The senior was forever singing the
praises of her father’s new acquisition. Mr.
Steele had closed contracts to buy several of the
neighboring farms, so that, altogether, he hoped
to have more than a thousand acres in his estate.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>
</p>
<p>
“And, don’t you <em>dare</em> disappoint me, Ruthie
Fielding,” cried Madge, shaking her playfully.
“We won’t have any good time without you, and
you haven’t said you’d go yet!”
</p>
<p>
“But I can’t say so until I know myself,” Ruth
told her. “Uncle Jabez——”
</p>
<p>
“That uncle of yours must be a regular ogre,
just as Helen says.”
</p>
<p>
“What does Mercy say about him?” asked
Ruth, with a quiet smile. “Mercy knows him
fully as well, and she has a sharp tongue.”
</p>
<p>
“Humph! that’s odd, too. She doesn’t seem
to think your Uncle Jabez is a very harsh man.
She calls him ‘Dusty Miller,’ I know.”
</p>
<p>
“Uncle Jabez has a prickly rind, I guess,” said
Ruth. “But the meat inside is sweet. Only he’s
old-fashioned and he can’t get used to new-fashioned
ways. He doesn’t see any reason for my
‘traipsing around’ so much. I ought to be at the
mill between schooltimes, helping Aunt Alvirah—so
he says. And I am afraid he is right. I feel
condemned——”
</p>
<p>
“You’re too tender-hearted. Helen says he’s
as rich as can be and might hire a dozen girls to
help ‘Aunt Alviry’.”
</p>
<p>
“He might, but he wouldn’t,” returned Ruth,
smiling. “I can’t tell you yet for sure that I
can go to Sunrise Farm. I’d love to. I’ve always
heard ’twas a beautiful place.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>
</p>
<p>
“And it is, indeed! It’s going to be the finest
gentleman’s estate in that section, when father
gets through with it. He’s going to make it a
great, big, paying farm—so he says. If it wasn’t
for that man Caslon, we’d own the whole hill
all the way around, as well as the top of it.”
</p>
<p>
“Who’s that?” asked Ruth, surprised that
Madge should speak so sharply about the unknown
Caslon.
</p>
<p>
“Why, he owns one of the farms adjoining.
Father’s bought all the neighbors up but Caslon.
<em>He</em> won’t sell. But I reckon father will find a
way to make him, before he gets through. Father
usually carries his point,” added Madge, with
much pride in Mr. Steele’s business acumen.
</p>
<p>
Uncle Jabez had not yet said Ruth could go
with the crowd to the Steeles’ summer home;
Aunt Alvirah wrote that he was “studyin’ about
it.” But there was so much to do at Briarwood
as the end of the school year approached, that
the girl of the Red Mill had little time to worry
about the subject.
</p>
<p>
Although Ruth and Helen Cameron were far
from graduation themselves, they both had parts
of some prominence in the exercises which were
to close the year at Briarwood Hall. Ruth was
in a quartette selected from the Glee Club for
some special music, and Helen had a small violin
solo part in one of the orchestral numbers.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>
</p>
<p>
Not many of the juniors, unless they belonged
to either the school orchestra or the Glee Club,
would appear to much advantage at graduation.
The upper senior class was in the limelight—and
Madge Steele was the only one of Ruth’s close
friends who was to receive her diploma.
</p>
<p>
“We who aren’t seniors have to sit around
like bumps on a log,” growled Heavy. “Might
as well go home for good the day before.”
</p>
<p>
“You should have learned to play, or sing, or
something,” advised one of the other girls, laughing
at Heavy’s apparently woebegone face.
</p>
<p>
“Did you ever hear me try to sing, Lluella?”
demanded the plump young lady. “I like music
myself—I’m very fond of it, no matter how it
sounds! But I can’t even stand my own chest-tones.”
</p>
<p>
Preparations for the great day went on apace.
There was to be a professional director for the
augmented orchestra and he insisted, because of
the acoustics of the hall, upon building an elevated
extension to the stage, upon which to stand to
conduct the music.
</p>
<p>
“Gee!” gasped Heavy, when she saw it the
first time. “What’s the diving-board for?”
</p>
<p>
“That’s not a diving-board,” snapped Mercy
Curtis. “It’s the lookout station for the captain
to watch the high C’s.”
</p>
<p>
The bustle and confusion of departure punctuated the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>
final day of the term, too. There were
so many girls to say good-bye to for the summer;
and some, of course, would never come back to
Briarwood Hall again—as scholars, at least.
</p>
<p>
In the midst of the excitement Ruth received a
letter in the crabbed hand of dear old Aunt Alvirah.
The old lady enclosed a small money
order, fearing that Ruth might not have all the
money she needed for her home-coming. But the
best item in the letter beside the expression of
Aunt Alvirah’s love, was the statement that
“Your Uncle Jabe, he’s come round to agreeing
you should go to that Sunrise Farm place with
your young friends. I made him let me hire a
tramping girl that came by, and we got the house
all rid up, so when you come home, my pretty, all
you got to do is to visit.”
</p>
<p>
“And I <em>will</em> visit with her—the unselfish old
dear!” Ruth told herself. “Dear me! how very,
very good everybody is to me. But I am afraid
poor Uncle Jabez wouldn’t be so kind if he wasn’t
influenced by Aunt Alvirah.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span><a name='chV' id='chV'></a>CHAPTER V—“THE TRAMPING GAL”</h2>
<p>
The old clock that had hung in the Red Mill
kitchen from the time of Uncle Jabez Potter’s
grandfather—and that was early time on the Lumano,
indeed!—hesitatingly tolled the hour of
four.
</p>
<p>
Daybreak was just behind the eastern hills. A
light mist swathed the silent current of the river.
Here and there, along the water’s edge, a tall
tree seemed floating in the air, its bole and roots
cut off by the drifting mist.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, it is very, very beautiful here!” sighed
Ruth Fielding, kneeling at the open window and
looking out upon the awakening world—as she
had done many and many another early morning
since first she was given this little gable-windowed
room for her very own.
</p>
<p>
The sweet, clean, cool air breathed in upon her
bare throat and shoulders, revealed through the
lace trimming of her night robe. Ruth loved
linen like other girls, and although Uncle Jabez
gave her spending money with a rather niggardly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>
hand, she and Aunt Alvirah knew how to make
the pennies “go a long way” in purchasing and
making her gowns and undergarments.
</p>
<p>
There lay over a chair, too, a pretty, light blue,
silk trimmed crepe-cloth kimona, with warm, fur-edged
slippers to match, on the floor. The moment
she heard Uncle Jabez rattle the stove-shaker
in the kitchen, Ruth slipped into this robe,
and thrust her bare feet into the slippers. Her
braids she drew over her shoulders—one on
either side—as she hurried out of the little chamber
and down the back stairs.
</p>
<p>
She had arrived home from Briarwood the
night before. For more than eight months she
had seen neither Uncle Jabez nor Aunt Alvirah;
and she had been so tired and sleepy on her arrival
that she had quickly gone to bed. She felt
as though she had scarcely greeted the two old
people.
</p>
<p>
Uncle Jabez was bending over the kitchen
stove. He always looked gray of face, and dusty.
The mill-dust seemed ground into both his clothes
and his complexion.
</p>
<p>
The first the old man knew of her presence,
the arms of Ruth were around his neck.
</p>
<p>
“Ugh-huh?” questioned the old man, raising
up stiffly as the fire began to chatter, the flames
flashing under the lids, and turned to face the girl
who held him so lovingly. “What’s wanted,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>
Niece Ruth?” he added, looking at her grimly
under his bristling brows.
</p>
<p>
Ruth was not afraid of his grimness. She had
learned long since that Uncle Jabez was much
softer under the surface than he appeared. He
claimed to be only just to her; but Ruth knew
that his “justice” often leaned toward the side
of mercy.
</p>
<p>
Her mother, Mary Potter, had been the
miller’s favorite niece; when she had married
Ruth’s father, Uncle Jabez had been angry, and
for years the family had been separated. But
when Uncle Jabez had taken Ruth in “just out
of charity,” old Aunt Alvirah had assured the
heartsick girl that the miller was kinder at heart
than he wished people to suppose.
</p>
<p>
“He don’t never let his right hand know what
his left hand doeth,” declared the loyal little old
woman who had been so long housekeeper for
the miller. “He saved me from the poorhouse—yes,
he did!—jest to git all the work out o’ me
he could—to hear him tell it!
</p>
<p>
“But it ain’t so,” quoth Aunt Alvirah, shaking
her head. “He saw a lone ol’ woman turned
out o’ what she’d thought would be her home
till she come to death’s door. An’ so he opened
his house and his hand to her. An’ he’s opened
his house and hand to <em>you</em>, my pretty; and who
knows? mebbe ’twill open wide his heart, too.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>
</p>
<p>
Ruth had been hoping the old man’s heart <em>was</em>
open, not only to her, but to the whole world.
She knew that, in secret, Uncle Jabez was helping
to pay Mercy Curtis’s tuition at Briarwood. He
still loved money; he always would love it, in all
probability. But he had learned to “loosen up,”
as Tom Cameron expressed it, in a most astonishing
way. One could not honestly call Uncle Jabez
a miser nowadays.
</p>
<p>
He was miserly in the outward expression of
any affection, however. And that apparent coldness
Ruth Fielding longed to break down.
</p>
<p>
Now the girl, all flushed from her deep sleep,
and smiling, lifted her rosy lips to be kissed. “I
didn’t scarcely say ‘how-do’ to you last night,
Uncle,” she said. “Do tell me you’re glad to
see me back.”
</p>
<p>
“Ha! Ye ain’t minded to stay long, it seems.”
</p>
<p>
“I won’t go to Sunrise Farm if you want me
here, Uncle Jabez,” declared Ruth, still clinging
to him, and with the same smiling light in
her eyes.
</p>
<p>
“Ha! ye don’t mean that,” he grunted.
</p>
<p>
He knew she did. His wrinkled, hard old face
finally began to change. His eyes tried to escape
her gaze.
</p>
<p>
“I just <em>love</em> you, Uncle,” she breathed, softly.
“Won’t—won’t you let me?”
</p>
<p>
“There, there, child!” He tried for a moment to break
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>
her firm hold; then he stooped
shamefacedly and touched her fresh lips with his
own.
</p>
<p>
Ruth nestled against his big, strong body, and
clung a moment longer. His rough hand
smoothed her sleek head almost timidly.
</p>
<p>
“There, there!” he grumbled. “You’re gittin’
to be a big gal, I swow! And what good’s
so much schoolin’ goin’ ter do ye? Other gals
like you air helpin’ in their mothers’ kitchens—or
goin’ to work in the mills at Cheslow. Seems
like a wicked waste of time and money.”
</p>
<p>
But he did not say it so harshly as had been his
wont in the old times. Ruth smiled up at him
again.
</p>
<p>
“Trust me, Uncle,” she said. “The time’ll
come when I’ll prove to you the worth of it.
Give me the education I crave, and I’ll support
myself and pay you all back—with interest! You
see if I don’t.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, well! It’s new-fashioned, I s’pose,”
growled the old man, starting for the mill. “Gals,
as well as boys, is lots more expense now than
they used ter be to raise. The ‘three R’s’ was
enough for us when I was young.
</p>
<p>
“But I won’t stop yer fun. I promised yer
Aunt Alviry I wouldn’t,” he added, with his hand
upon the door-latch. “You kin go to that Sunrise
place for a while, if ye want. Yer Aunt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>
Alviry got a trampin’ gal that came along, ter
help her clean house.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! and isn’t the girl here now?” asked
Ruth, preparing to run back to dress.
</p>
<p>
“Nope. She’s gone on. Couldn’t keep her no
longer. And my! how that young ’un could eat!
Never saw the beat of her,” added Uncle Jabez
as he clumped out in his heavy boots.
</p>
<p>
Ruth heard more about “that trampin’ girl”
when Aunt Alvirah appeared. Before that happened,
however, the newly returned schoolgirl
proved she had not forgotten how to make a
country breakfast.
</p>
<p>
The sliced corned ham was frying nicely; the
potatoes were browning delightfully in another
pan. Fluffy biscuits were ready to take out of
the oven, and the cream was already whipped for
the berries and the coffee.
</p>
<p>
“Gracious me! child alive!” exclaimed the
little old woman, coming haltingly into the room.
“You an’ Jabez air in a conspiracy to spile me—right
from the start. Oh, my back! and oh, my
bones!” and she lowered herself carefully into a
chair.
</p>
<p>
“I did sartain sure oversleep this day. Ben
done the chores? An’ ye air all ready, my pretty?
Jest blow the horn, then, and yer uncle will come
in. My! what a smart leetle housekeeper you be,
Ruth. School ain’t spiled ye a mite.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>
</p>
<p>
“Uncle is still afraid it will,” laughed Ruth,
kissing the old woman fondly.
</p>
<p>
“He only <em>says</em> that,” whispered Aunt Alvirah,
with twinkling eyes. “He’s as proud of ye as he
can stick—I know!”
</p>
<p>
“It—it would be nice, if he said so once in a
while,” admitted the girl.
</p>
<p>
After the hearty breakfast was disposed of and
the miller and his hired man had tramped out
again, the old housekeeper and Ruth became more
confidential.
</p>
<p>
“It sartain sure did please me,” said Aunt
Alvirah, “when Jabez let me take in that
trampin’ gal for a week an’ more. He paid her
without a whimper, too. But, she <em>did</em> eat!”
</p>
<p>
“So he said,” chuckled Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. More’n a hired hand in thrashin’ time.
I never seen her beat. But I reckon the poor
little thing was plumb starved. They never feed
’em ha’f enough in them orphan ‘sylums, I don’t
s’pect.”
</p>
<p>
“From an orphanage?” cried Ruth, with sudden
interest born of her remembrance of the
mysterious Sadie Raby.
</p>
<p>
“So I believe. She’d run away, I s’pect. I
hadn’t the heart to blame her. An’ she was close-mouthed
as a clam,” declared Aunt Alvirah.
</p>
<p>
“How did you come to get her?” queried the
interested Ruth.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>
</p>
<p>
“She walked right up to the door. She’d been
travelin’ far—ye could see that by her shoes, if
ye could call ’em shoes. I made her take ’em off
by the fire, an’ then I picked ’em up with the
tongs—they was just pulp—and I pitched ’em
onto the ash-heap.
</p>
<p>
“Well, she stayed that night, o’ course. It
was rainin’. Your Uncle Jabez wouldn’t ha’
turned a dog out in sech weather. But he made
me put her to bed on chairs here.
</p>
<p>
“It was plain she was delighted to have somebody
to talk to—and as that somebody was ‘her
pretty,’ the dear old soul was all the more joyful.
</p>
<p>
“So, one thing led to another,” pursued Aunt
Alvirah, “and I got him to let me keep her to
help rid the house up. You know, you wrote me
to wait till you come home for house-cleanin’.
But I worked Jabez Potter <em>right</em>; I know how to
manage him,” said she, nodding and smiling.
</p>
<p>
“And you didn’t know who the girl was?”
asked Ruth, still curious. “Nothing about her
at all?”
</p>
<p>
“Not much. She was short-tongued, I tell ye.
But I gathered she had been an orphan a long
time and had lived at an institution.”
</p>
<p>
“Not even her name?” asked Ruth, at last.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes. She told her name—and it was
her true one, I reckon,” Aunt Alviry said. “It
was Sadie Raby.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span><a name='chVI' id='chVI'></a>CHAPTER VI—SEEKING THE TRAIL</h2>
<p>
“I might have known that! I might have
known it!” Ruth exclaimed when she heard this.
“And if I’d only written you or Uncle Jabez
about her, maybe you would have kept her till
I came. I wanted to help that girl,” and Ruth
all but shed tears.
</p>
<p>
“Deary, deary me!” cried Aunt Alvirah.
“Tell me all about it, my pretty.”
</p>
<p>
So Ruth related all she knew about the half-wild
girl whose acquaintance she had made at
Briarwood Hall under such peculiar circumstances.
And she told just how Sadie looked
and all about her.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” agreed Aunt Alvirah. “That was the
trampin’ gal sure enough. She was honest, jest
as you say. But your uncle had his doubts.
However, she looked better when she went away
from here.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m glad of that,” Ruth said, heartily.
</p>
<p>
“You know one o’ them old dresses of yours
you wore to Miss Cramp’s school—the one Helen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>
give you?” said old Aunt Alvirah, hesitatingly.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, indeed!” said Ruth. “And how badly
I felt when the girls found out they were ‘hand-me-downs.’
I’ll never forget them.”
</p>
<p>
“One of them I fitted to that poor child,”
said Aunt Alvirah. “The poor, skinny little
thing. I wisht I could ha’ kep’ her long enough
to put some flesh on her bones.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth hugged the little old woman. “You’re
a dear, Aunty! I bet you fixed her up nice before
she went away.”
</p>
<p>
“Wal, she didn’t look quite sech a tatterdemalion,”
granted Aunt Alvirah. “But I was
sorry for her. I am allus sorry for any young
thing that’s strayin’ about without a home or a
mother. But natcherly Jabez wouldn’t hear to
keepin’ her after the cleanin’ was done. It’s his
<em>nearness</em>, Ruthie; he can’t help it. Some men
chew tobacco, and your Uncle Jabez is <em>close</em>.
It’s their nater. I’d ruther have a stingy man
about, than a tobacco chewin’ man—yes, indeed
I had!”
</p>
<p>
Ruth laughed and agreed with her. Yet she
was very sorry that Sadie Raby, “the tramping
girl,” had been allowed to move on without those
at the Red Mill, who had sheltered her, discovering
her destination.
</p>
<p>
She learned that Sadie had gone to Cheslow—at
least, in that direction—and when Helen came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>
spinning along in one of her father’s cars from
Outlook that afternoon, and wanted to take
Ruth for a drive, the latter begged to ride
“Cheslowward.”
</p>
<p>
“Besides, we both want to see Dr. Davison—and
there’s Mercy’s mother. And Miss Cramp
will be glad to see me, I know; we’ll wait till
her school is out,” Ruth suggested.
</p>
<p>
“You’re boss,” declared her chum. “And
paying calls ‘all by our lonesomes’ will be fun
enough. Tom’s deserted me. He’s gone tramping
with Reno over toward the Wilkins Corner
road—you know, that place where he was hurt
that time, and you and Reno found him,” Helen
concluded.
</p>
<p>
This was “harking back” to the very first
night Ruth had arrived at Cheslow from her old
home at Darrowtown. But she was not likely to
forget it, for through that accident of Master
Tom Cameron’s, she had met this very dear
friend beside her now in the automobile.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear me! and the fun we used to have
when we were little girls—‘member, Ruthie?”
demanded Helen, laughing. “My! isn’t it warm?
Is my face shiny?”
</p>
<p>
“Just a little,” admitted Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Never can keep the shine off,” said Helen,
bitterly. “Here! you take the wheel and let me
find my powder-paper. Tom says he believes I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>
smoke cigarettes and roll them myself,” and
Helen giggled.
</p>
<p>
Ruth carefully changed seats with her chum,
who immediately produced the booklet of slips
from her vanity case and rubbed the offending
nose vigorously.
</p>
<p>
“Have a care, Helen! you’ll make it all red,”
urged Ruth, laughing. “You <em>do</em> go at everything
so excitedly. Anybody would think you
were grating a nutmeg.”
</p>
<p>
“Horrid thing! My nose doesn’t look at all
like a nutmeg.”
</p>
<p>
“But it will—if you don’t look out,” laughed
Ruth. “Oh, dear, me! here comes a big wagon.
Do you suppose I can get by it safely?”
</p>
<p>
“If he gives you any room. There! he has
begun to turn out. Now, just skim around
him.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth was careful and slowed down. This did
not suit the fly-away Helen. “Come on!” she
urged. “We’ll never even get to the old doctor’s
house if you don’t hurry.”
</p>
<p>
She began to manipulate the levers herself and
soon they were shooting along the Cheslow road
at a speed that made Ruth’s eyes water.
</p>
<p>
They came safely to the house with the green
lamps before it, and ran in gaily to see their
friend, Dr. Davison. For the moment the good
old gentleman chanced to be busy and waved
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>
them into the back office to wait until he was
free.
</p>
<p>
Old Mammy, who presided over the doctor’s
old-fashioned establishment, had spied the girls
and almost immediately the tinkling of ice in a
pitcher announced the approach of one of
Mammy’s pickaninny grandchildren with a supply
of her famous lemonade and a plate of cakes.
</p>
<p>
“Mammy said you done git hungery waitin’,”
declared the grinning, kinky-haired child who presented
herself with the refreshments. “An’ a
drink on one o’ dese yere dusty days is allus
welcome, misses.”
</p>
<p>
Then she giggled, and darted away to the lower
regions of the house, leaving the two chums to
enjoy the goodies. Helen was cheerfully curious,
and had to go looking about the big office, peeking
into the bookcases, looking at the “specimens”
in bottles along the shelf, trying to spell
out and understand the Latin labels on the jars
of drugs.
</p>
<p>
“Miss Nosey!” whispered Ruth, admonishingly.
</p>
<p>
“There you go! hitting my nose again,” sighed
Helen. And then she jumped back and almost
screamed. For in fooling with the knob of a
narrow closet door, it had snapped open, the
door swung outward, and Helen found herself
facing an articulated skeleton!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>
</p>
<p>
“Goodness gracious me!” exclaimed Helen.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no,” giggled Ruth. “It’s not you at
all. It’s somebody else.”
</p>
<p>
“Funny!” scoffed Helen. Then she laughed,
too. “It’s somebody the doctor’s awfully choice
of. Do you suppose it was his first patient?”
</p>
<p>
“Hush! Suppose he heard you?”
</p>
<p>
“He’d laugh,” returned Helen, knowing the
kindly old physician too well to be afraid of him
in any case. “Now, behave! Don’t say a word.
I’m going to dress him up.”
</p>
<p>
“What?” gasped Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“You’ll see,” said the daring Helen, and she
seized an old hat of the doctor’s from the top
of the bookcase and set it jauntily upon the grinning
skull.
</p>
<p>
“My goodness! doesn’t he look terrible that
way? Oh! I’ll shut the door. He wiggles all
over—<em>just as though he were alive</em>!”
</p>
<p>
Just then they heard the doctor bidding his
caller good-bye, or Helen might have done some
other ridiculous thing. The old gentleman came
in, rubbing his hands, and with his eyes twinkling.
He was a man who had never really grown old,
and he liked to hear the girls tell of their school
experiences, chuckling over their scrapes and
antics with much delight.
</p>
<p>
“And how has my Goody Two-sticks gotten
along this year?” he asked, for he was much
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>
interested in Mercy Curtis and her improvement,
both physically and mentally. Had it not been
for the doctor, Mercy might never have gotten
out of her wheelchair, or gone to Briarwood
Hall.
</p>
<p>
“She’s going to beat us all,” Helen declared,
with enthusiasm. “Isn’t she, Ruth?”
</p>
<p>
“She will if we don’t work pretty hard,” admitted
the girl of the Red Mill, who was hoping
herself to be finally among the first few members
of her class at the Hall. “But I would rather
see Mercy win first place, I believe, than anybody
else—unless it is you, Helen.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you fret,” laughed Helen. “You’ll
never see little me at the head of the class—and
you know it.”
</p>
<p>
The two friends did not bore the physician by
staying too long, but after he bade them good-bye
at the door, Helen ran down the path giggling.
</p>
<p>
“What do you suppose he’ll say when he finds
that hat on the skeleton?” she demanded, her
eyes dancing.
</p>
<p>
“He’ll say, ‘That Helen Cameron was in
here—that explains it!’ You can’t fool Dr.
Davison,” laughed Ruth.
</p>
<p>
Ruth had taken Helen into her confidence ere
this about the strange runaway, Sadie Raby, and
during their call at the doctor’s, she had asked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>
that gentleman if he had seen the tramping girl,
after the latter had left the Red Mill. But he had
not. Oddly enough, however, Ruth found some
trace of Sadie at Mercy’s house, where the girls
in the automobile next went to call.
</p>
<p>
Mercy’s mother had taken the girl in for a
night, and fed her. The latter had asked Mr.
Curtis about the trains going west, but he had
sold Sadie no ticket.
</p>
<p>
“She was very reticent,” Mrs. Curtis told
Ruth. “She was so independent and capable-acting,
in spite of her tender years, that I did
not feel as though it was my place to try to stop
her. She seemed to have some destination in
view, but she would not tell me what it was.”
</p>
<p>
“I wonder if that wasn’t what Aunt Alvirah
meant?” queried Ruth, thoughtfully, as she and
Helen drove away. “That Sadie is awfully independent.
I wish you had seen her.”
</p>
<p>
“Maybe she’s going to find her twin brothers
that she told you about,” suggested Helen. “I
wish I <em>had</em> seen her.”
</p>
<p>
“And maybe you’ve guessed it!” cried Ruth.
“But that doesn’t help us find <em>her</em>, for she didn’t
say where Willie and Dickie had been taken
when they were removed from the orphanage.”
</p>
<p>
“Gracious, Ruthie!” exclaimed her chum,
laughing. “You’re always worrying over somebody
else’s troubles.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span><a name='chVII' id='chVII'></a>CHAPTER VII—WHAT TOM CAMERON SAW</h2>
<p>
Of course, Ruth was not at all sure that she
could do anything for Sadie Raby if she found
her. Perhaps, as Helen said, she was fond of
shouldering other people’s burdens.
</p>
<p>
It did seem to the girl of the Red Mill as
though it were a very dreadful thing for Sadie
to be wandering about the country all alone, and
without means to feed herself, or get anything
like proper shelter.
</p>
<p>
In her secret heart Ruth was thinking that <em>she</em>
might have been as wild and neglected if Uncle
Jabez, with all his crankiness, had not taken her
in and given her a home at the Red Mill.
</p>
<p>
They stopped and saw Ruth’s old school
teacher and then, it being past mid-afternoon,
Helen turned the headlights of the car toward
home again. As the machine slid so smoothly
along the road toward the Lumano and the Red
Mill, Ruth suddenly uttered a cry and pointed
ahead. A huge dog had leaped out of a side
road and stood, barring their way and barking.
</p>
<p>
“Reno! dear old fellow!” Ruth said, as Helen
shut off the power. “He knows us.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>
</p>
<p>
“Tom must be near, then. That’s the Wilkins
Corner road,” Helen observed.
</p>
<p>
As the car came to a halt and the big mastiff
tried to jump in and caress the girls with his
tongue—poor fellow! he knew no better, though
Helen scolded him—Ruth stood up and shouted
for her friend’s twin brother.
</p>
<p>
“Tom! Tom! A rescue! a rescue! We’re
being eaten up by a great four-legged beast—get
down, Reno! Oh, don’t!”
</p>
<p>
She fell back in her seat, laughing merrily, and
keeping the big dog off with both hands. A
cheery whistle came from the wood. Reno
started and turned to look. He had had his master
back for only a day, but Tom’s word was
always law to the big mastiff.
</p>
<p>
“Down, sir!” sang out Tom Cameron, and
then he burst into view.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Tom! what a sight you are!” gasped
Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“My goodness me!” exclaimed his sister.
“Have you been in a fight?”
</p>
<p>
“Down, Reno!” commanded her brother
again. He came striding toward them. If he
had not been so disheveled, anybody could have
seen that, dressed in his sister’s clothes, and she
in his, one could scarcely have told them apart.
A boy and a girl never could look more alike
than Tom and Helen Cameron.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>
</p>
<p>
“What has happened to you?” demanded
Ruth, quite as anxious as Tom’s own sister.
</p>
<p>
“Look like I’d been monkeying with the buzz-saw—eh?”
he demanded, but a little ruefully.
“Say! I’ve had a time. If it hadn’t been for
Reno——”
</p>
<p>
“Why, Reno has hurt himself, too!” exclaimed
Ruth, hopping out of the car and for
the first time noticing that there was a cake of
partially dried blood on the dog’s shoulder.
</p>
<p>
“He isn’t hurt much. And neither am I.
Only my clothes torn——”
</p>
<p>
“And your face scratched!” ejaculated Helen.
</p>
<p>
“Oh—well—<em>that’s</em> nothing. That was an
accident. She didn’t mean to do it.”
</p>
<p>
“<em>Who</em> didn’t mean to do it? What <em>are</em> you
talking about?” screamed his sister, at last fully
aroused. “You’ve been in some terrible danger,
Tom Cameron.”
</p>
<p>
“No, I haven’t,” returned Tom, beginning to
grin again. “Just been playing the chivalrous
knight.”
</p>
<p>
“And got his face scratched!” tittered Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Aw—well—— Now wait! let me tell you,”
he began.
</p>
<p>
“Now he’s going to make excuses,” cried
Helen. “You have gotten into trouble, you reckless
boy, and want to make light of it.”
</p>
<p>
“Gee! I’d like to see <em>you</em> make light of it,”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>
exclaimed Tom, with some vexation. “If you
can make head or tail of it—— And that girl!”
</p>
<p>
“There he goes again,” said Ruth. “He has
got to tell us. It is about a girl,” and she laughed,
teasingly.
</p>
<p>
“Say! I don’t know which one of you is the
worse,” said Tom, ruefully. “Listen, will you?”
</p>
<p>
“Go ahead,” said Helen, solemnly.
</p>
<p>
“Well, Reno and I were hiking along the
Wilkins Corner road yonder. It was just about
where your Uncle Jabe’s wagon, Ruth, knocked
me down into the gully that time—remember?”
</p>
<p>
Ruth nodded.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I heard somebody scream. It was a
girl. Reno began to growl and I held him back
till I located the trouble. There was a campfire
down under that bank and the scream came from
that direction.
</p>
<p>
“‘Go to it, old boy!’ I says, and let Reno go.
I had no reason to believe there was real
trouble,” Tom said, wagging his head. “But I
followed him down the bank just the same, for
although Reno wouldn’t bite anybody unless he
had to, he does look ugly—to strangers.
</p>
<p>
“Well, what do you think? There were a
couple of tramps at the fire, and Reno was holding
them off from a girl. He showed his teeth
all right, and one of them had his knife out. <em>He</em>
was an ugly looking customer.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>
</p>
<p>
“My goodness! a girl?” gasped his sister.
“What sort of a looking girl?”
</p>
<p>
“She wasn’t bad looking,” Tom said.
“Younger than us—mebbe twelve, or so. But
she’d been sleeping out in her clothes—you could
see she had. And her face and hands were dirty.
</p>
<p>
“‘What were they trying to do to you?’ I
asked her.
</p>
<p>
“‘Trying to get my money,’ says she. ‘I ain’t
got much, but you bet I want that little.’
</p>
<p>
“‘I guess you can keep it,’ I said. ‘But if I
were you, I’d hike out of this.’
</p>
<p>
“‘I’m going to,’ says she. ‘I’m going just as
fast as I can to the railroad and jump a train.
These fellers have been bothering me all day.
I’m glad you came along. Thanks.’
</p>
<p>
“And with that she started to move off. But
the tramps were real ugly, and one of them
jumped for her. I tripped him up,” said Tom,
grinning again now in remembrance of the row,
“and then there certainly <em>was</em> a fuss.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Tom!” murmured Helen.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I had Reno, didn’t I? The man I
tripped fell into the fire, but was more scared
than hurt. But the other fellow—the one with
the knife—slashed at Reno, and cut him.
</p>
<p>
“Well! you never saw such a girl as that
tramping girl was——”
</p>
<p>
“What’s <em>that</em>?” gasped Ruth. “Oh, Helen!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>
</p>
<p>
“It might be Sadie Raby—eh?” queried her
chum.
</p>
<p>
“Hel-lo!” exclaimed Master Tom, turning
curious. “What do you girls know about her?
Sadie Raby—that’s what she said her name was.”
</p>
<p>
“My goodness me! What do you think of
that?” cried his sister.
</p>
<p>
“And where is she now?” demanded Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Aw, wait till I tell you all about it,” complained
Tom. “You girls take the wind all out
of my sails.”
</p>
<p>
“All right. Go ahead,” begged his sister.
</p>
<p>
“So, that Sadie girl, she came back to my help,
and when one of the fellows had me down, and
Reno was holding the other by the wrist, she
started to dig into the face of the rascal who
held me. And once she scratched me by mistake,”
added Tom, laughing.
</p>
<p>
“But between us—mostly through Reno’s
help—we frightened them off. They hobbled
away through the bushes. Then I took her to
the railroad, and waited at the tank till a train
came along and stopped.”
</p>
<p>
“And put her aboard, Tom!” cried Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. It was a freight. I bribed the conductor
with two dollars to let her ride as far as
Campton. I knew those two tramps would never
catch her there. Why! what’s the matter?”
</p>
<p>
“Goodness me!” exclaimed Helen, with disgust. “Doesn’t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>
it take a boy to spoil everything?”
</p>
<p>
“Why—what?” began Tom.
</p>
<p>
“And her name was Sadie Raby?” demanded
Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“That’s what she said.”
</p>
<p>
“We just wanted to see her, that’s all,” said
his sister. “Ruth did, anyway. And I’d have
been glad to help her.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I helped her, didn’t I?” demanded
Tom, rather doggedly.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. Just like a boy. What do you suppose
is to become of a girl like her traveling
around the country?”
</p>
<p>
“She seemed to want to get to Campton real
bad. I reckon she has folks there,” said Tom,
slowly.
</p>
<p>
“She’s got no folks—if her story is true,” said
Ruth, quietly, “save two little brothers.”
</p>
<p>
“And they’re twins, like us, Tom,” said Helen,
eagerly. “Oh, dear! it’s too bad Ruth and I
didn’t come across Sadie, instead of you.”
</p>
<p>
Tom began to laugh at that. “You’d have had
a fine time getting her away from those tramps,”
he scoffed. “She didn’t have but a little money,
and they would have stolen that from her if it
hadn’t been for Reno and me.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span><a name='chVIII' id='chVIII'></a>CHAPTER VIII—TRAVELING TOWARD SUNRISE FARM</h2>
<p>
Tom Cameron thought a great deal of Ruth,
and for that reason alone was sorry he had not
stayed the departure of the runaway girl, Sadie
Raby, from the vicinity of Cheslow. Then, as
he thought of it more, and heard the girls talk
about the tramping girl’s circumstances as <em>they</em>
knew them, Tom was even more disturbed.
</p>
<p>
He and Reno had gotten into the tonneau of
the car, which rolled away toward the Red Mill
at a slower pace. He leaned his arms on the
back of the front seat and listened to Ruth’s story
of her meeting with Sadie Raby, and her experience
with Sim Perkins, and of her surprise at
finding that Sadie had worked for a while at the
Red Mill.
</p>
<p>
“If we had only been a few days earlier in
getting home from school, there she would have
been,” finished Ruth, with a sigh.
</p>
<p>
“That’s so,” agreed her chum. “And she
even stayed night before last with Mercy’s
mother. My! but she’s as elusive as a will-o’-the-wisp.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>
</p>
<p>
“We could telegraph to Campton and have
her stopped,” suggested Tom.
</p>
<p>
“By the police?” demanded his sister.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! what for?” asked Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“There! nothing <em>I</em> suggest is any good,” said
the boy.
</p>
<p>
“Not unless you suggest something better than
that,” laughed Ruth. “The poor thing doesn’t
need to be arrested. And she might refuse any
help we could give her. She’s very independent.”
</p>
<p>
“She sure is,” admitted Tom, ruefully.
</p>
<p>
“And we don’t know <em>why</em> she wanted to go to
Campton,” his sister remarked.
</p>
<p>
“Nor if she got there safely,” added Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Pshaw! if that’s worrying you two, I’ll find
out for sure to-morrow,” quoth Master Tom.
</p>
<p>
He knew the conductor of the freight train
with whom he had entrusted the strange girl. The
next day he went over to the tank at the right
hour and met the conductor again.
</p>
<p>
“Sure, I got her on to Campton—poor kid,”
said the man. “She’s a smart one, too. When
the boys wanted to know who she was, I said she
was my niece, and she nodded and agreed to it.
We had a big feed back here in the hack while she
was aboard, and she had her share.”
</p>
<p>
“But where was she going?” asked Tom.
</p>
<p>
“Didn’t get much out of her,” admitted the
conductor. “But she’d lived in Harburg, and I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>
reckon she had folks in or near Campton. But
I’m not sure at all.”
</p>
<p>
This was rather unsatisfactory; but whatever
point the strange girl was journeying to, she had
arrived safely at Campton. This Tom told Ruth
and the latter had to be content with this information.
</p>
<p>
The incident of the runaway girl was two or
three days old when Ruth received a letter from
Madge Steele urging them all to come on soon—that
Sunrise Farm was ready for them, and that
she was writing all the girls to start on Monday.
</p>
<p>
The train would take them to Darrowtown.
There a conveyance would meet and transport
the visitors fifteen miles through the country to
Mr. Steele’s big estate.
</p>
<p>
Mercy Curtis joined the Camerons and Ruth
at the Cheslow Station, and on the train they
boarded were Heavy Stone and The Fox. The
girls greeted each other as though they had been
separated for a year.
</p>
<p>
“Never was such a clatter of tongues,” declared
the plump girl, “since the workmen struck
on the tower of Babel. Here we are—off for
the sunrise—and traveling due west. How do
you make that out?”
</p>
<p>
“That’s easy—anybody could see it with half
an eye,” said The Fox.
</p>
<p>
“Half an eye, eh?” demanded Heavy. “And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>
Cyclops had a whole one. Say! did you hear
about the boy in school who was asked by his
teacher (he must have been in Tommy’s class)
‘Who was Cyclops?’ He was a bright boy. He
answered: ‘The man who wrote the encyclopædia.’
The association of ideas was something
fierce—eh?”
</p>
<p>
“Dear me, Jennie,” admonished The Fox,
“you are getting slangier every day.”
</p>
<p>
“Never mind; I’m not losing flesh over it.
Don’t you,” returned the careless “heavyweight.”
</p>
<p>
It was a long, but not a tedious, ride to Darrowtown.
The young folk had left Cheslow just
before dark, and their sleeper was sidetracked
at the end of the journey, some time in the very
early morning. When Ruth first opened her
eyes she could scarcely—for the moment—think
where she was.
</p>
<p>
Then she peered out of the narrow window
above her berth and saw a section of the railroad
yard and one side of Railroad Avenue beyond.
The right of way split Darrowtown in two halves
and there were grade crossings at the intersections
of the principal cross streets.
</p>
<p>
Long as she had been away from the place,
the girl recognized the houses and the stores, and
every other landmark she could see. No further
sleep for her, although it was scarcely dawn.
</p>
<p>
She hopped softly out of the berth, disturbed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>
none of her companions or even the porter nodding
in his corner, and dressed hurriedly. She
made her toilette and then went into the vestibule
and from thence climbed down to the cinder path.
</p>
<p>
There was an opening in the picket fence, and
she slipped through in a moment. Dear old Darrowtown!
Ruth’s heart throbbed exultantly and
she smiled, although there were tears in her eyes.
</p>
<p>
There was the Brick Church on the corner.
The pastor and his wife had been so kind to her!
And up this next street was the way to the quiet
cemetery where her father and mother were
buried. Ruth turned her steps in that direction
first of all.
</p>
<p>
The sun came up, red and jovial; the birds
twittered and sang in the great maples along
the way; even in the graveyard a great flock of
blackbirds “pumped” and squeaked in noisy,
joyous chorus.
</p>
<p>
The dew sparkled on leaf and bush, the flowers
were fragrant, the cool breeze fanned her
cheek, and the bird chorus rose higher and higher.
How could one be sad long on such a beautiful,
God-made morning?
</p>
<p>
Impossible! Ruth plucked a spray of a flowering
shrub for both graves, and laid them on
the mounds tenderly, with a little prayer. Here
slept the dead peacefully, and God had raised
her up many, many friends!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>
</p>
<p>
The early chimneys were smoking in the suburbs
of the town. A screen-door slammed now
and then. One man whom she knew slightly, but
who did not remember her, was currying his
horse in an alley by his stable. Mrs. Barnsworth,
notably the smartest housewife in Darrowtown,
was starting already with her basket
for market—and woe be to the grocer or marketman
if the shops were not open when she arrived!
</p>
<p>
Stray cats ran along the back fences. A dog
ran out of a yard to bark at Ruth, but then
thought better of it and came to be patted instead.
</p>
<p>
And then, suddenly, she came in sight of the
back garden of Miss True Pettis!
</p>
<p>
It was with that kind-hearted but peculiar
spinster lady that Ruth had lived previous to
being sent to the Red Mill. Miss Pettis was
the neighborhood seamstress and, as she often
had told Ruth, she worked hard “with both tongue
and needle” for every dollar she earned.
</p>
<p>
For Miss True Pettis had something more
than dressmaking to do when she went out “by
the day” to cut and fit and run the sewing machine.
Darrowtown folk expected that the seamstress
should have all the latest gossip at her
tongue’s end when she came to sew!
</p>
<p>
Now, Miss True Pettis often laid down the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>
law. “There’s two kinds of gossip. One the
Bible calls the seventh abomination, an’ I guess
that’s right. But for shut-in folks like most
housekeepers in Darrowtown, a dish of harmless
gossip is more inspiritin’ than a bowl of boneset
tea!
</p>
<p>
“Lemme have somethin’ new to tell folks
about folks—that’s all. But it must be somethin’
kind,” Miss Pettis declared. “No backbitin’, or
church scandal, or neighborhood rows. If Si
Lumpkin’s cat has scratched Amoskeag Lanfell’s
dog, let the cat and the dog fight it out, I say; no
need for Si and Amoskeag, who have been friends
and neighbors for years an’ years, gettin’ into a
ruction over it.
</p>
<p>
“I never take sides in any controversy—no,
ma’am! If ye can’t say a good word for a
neighbor, don’t say nothin’ to <em>me</em>. That’s what
I tell ’em. But if ye know anythin’ good about
’em, or they’ve had any streak o’ good luck, or
the like, tell me. For the folks in this town—‘specially
the wimmen folks that don’t git out
much—is just a-honin’ for news, and True Pettis,
when she goes out by the day, has gotter have
a full and plenty supply of it.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth, smiling quietly to herself, remembered
how the thin, sallow, quick spoken lady looked
when she said all this. Miss Pettis’s eyes were
black and snapping; her nose was a beak; she bit
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>
off threads as though her temper was biting, too.
But Ruth knew better. A kinder-hearted mortal
never lived than the little old seamstress.
</p>
<p>
Now the visitor ran across the garden—neatly
bedded and with graveled paths in which the
tiniest weed dared not show its head—and reached
the kitchen porch. Miss Pettis was always an
early riser, and the smoke of her chimney was
now only a faint blue column rising into the clear
air.
</p>
<p>
Yes! there was a rattle of dishes in the kitchen.
Ruth tiptoed up the steps. Then she—to her
amazement—heard somebody groan. The sound
was repeated, and then the seamstress’s voice
murmured:
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear, oh, dear! Oh, dear, oh, dear!
whatever shall I do——”
</p>
<p>
Ruth, who had intended opening the door
softly and announcing that she had come to
breakfast, forgot all about the little surprise she
was bent on giving Miss Pettis. Now she peered
fearfully in at the nearest window.
</p>
<p>
Miss Pettis was just sitting down in her
rocker, and she rocked to and fro, holding one
hand with the other, continuing to groan.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear, me!” cried Ruth, bursting in at
the door. “What in the world is the matter,
my dear?”
</p>
<p>
“It’s that dratted felon—— Why, Ruthie
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>
Fielding! Did you drop from the sky, or pop
up out o’ the ground? I never!”
</p>
<p>
The dressmaker got up quickly, but struck her
hand against the chair-arm. Instantly she fell
back with a scream, and Ruth feared she had
fainted. A felon is a terribly painful thing!
</p>
<p>
Ruth ran for a glass of water, but before she
could sprinkle any of it on Miss Pettis’ pale face
the lady’s eyes opened and she exclaimed:
</p>
<p>
“Don’t drop any of that on my dress, child—it’ll
spot. I’m all right now. My mercy! how
that hurt.”
</p>
<p>
“A felon, Miss Pettis? How very dreadful,”
cried Ruth, setting down the glass of water.
</p>
<p>
“And I ain’t been able to use my needle for
a week, and the dishwashin’—well, it jest about
kills me to put my hands in water. You can see—the
sight this kitchen is.”
</p>
<p>
“Now, isn’t it lucky that I came this morning—and
came so early, too?” cried Ruth. “I
was going to take breakfast with you. Now I’ll
get the breakfast myself and fix up the house—— Oh,
yes, I shall! I’ll send word down to the
hotel to my friends—they’ll take breakfast there—and
we can have a nice visit, Miss True,” and
Ruth very carefully hugged the thin shoulders of
the seamstress, so as not to even jar the felon
on her right fore-finger.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span><a name='chIX' id='chIX'></a>CHAPTER IX—THE SUNRISE COACH</h2>
<p>
Ruth was determined to have her way, and
really, after one has suffered with a felon for a
week, one is in no shape to combat the determination
of as strong a character as that of the girl
of the Red Mill!
</p>
<p>
At least, so Miss True Pettis found. She
bowed to Ruth’s mandate, and sat meekly in the
rocking chair while that young lady bustled
about, made the toast, poached eggs, made a pot
of the kind of tea the spinster liked, and just
as she liked it—— Oh, Ruth had not forgotten
all her little ways, although she had been gone
so long from the seamstress’s tiny cottage here in
Darrowtown.
</p>
<p>
All the time, she was as cheerful as a bluebird—and
just as chatty as one, too! She ran out
and caught a neighbor’s boy, and sent him scurrying
down to the sidetracked sleeping car with a
note to Helen. The rest of the crowd expected
at Sunrise Farm would arrive on an early morning
train on the other road, and both parties were
to meet for breakfast at the Darrowtown Inn.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span>
</p>
<p>
The vehicle to transport them to the farm,
however, was not expected until ten o’clock.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, Ruth insisted, she had plenty of
time to fix up the house for Miss Pettis. This
she proceeded to do.
</p>
<p>
“I allus <em>did</em> say you was the handiest youngun
that ever was born in Darrowtown,” said the
seamstress, with a sigh of relief, as Ruth, enveloped
in a big apron, set to work.
</p>
<p>
Ruth did more than wash dishes, and sweep,
and clean, and scrub. All the time she told Miss
Pettis about her life at the Red Mill, and her
life at the boarding school, and of many and
various things that had happened to her since,
two years before, she had gone away from
Darrowtown to take up her new life with Uncle
Jabez.
</p>
<p>
Not that she had not frequently written to
Miss Pettis; but one cannot write the particulars
that can be told when two folks are “gossiping.”
Miss True Pettis had not enjoyed herself—felon
and all!—so much for ages as she did that forenoon.
</p>
<p>
And she would have a long and interesting
story to tell regarding “Mary Fielding’s little
girl” when again she took up her work of going
out by the day and bringing both her nimble
needle and her nimble tongue into the homes of
the busy Darrowtown housewives.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, Miss Pettis told Ruth all
the news of her old home; and although the girl
from the Red Mill had no time then to call upon
any other of her one-time friends—not even
Patsy Hope—she finally went away feeling just
as though she had met them all again. For little
of value escaped Miss Pettis, and she had told
it all.
</p>
<p>
The Brick Church clock was striking ten when
Ruth ran around the corner and came in sight of
the Darrowtown Inn. There was a crowd of girls
and boys on the porch, and before it stood a
great, shiny yellow coach, drawn by four sleek
horses.
</p>
<p>
“Bobbins” himself—Madge Steele’s big,
white-haired brother, who attended the military
academy with Tom Cameron, was already on the
coachman’s seat, holding the reins in most approved
style. Beside him sat a man in livery, it
was true; but Bob himself was going to drive
the four-in-hand.
</p>
<p>
“Isn’t that scrumptious, Ruth?” demanded
Belle Tingley, one of those who had arrived on
the other railroad. “Where have you been all
the time? Helen was worried for fear you
wouldn’t get here.”
</p>
<p>
“And here’s Ralph!” exclaimed Ruth, heartily
shaking hands with one of Belle’s brothers.
“I’m all right. I used to live here in Darrowtown,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>
you know, and I was making calls. And
here is Isadore!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I say, Ruth!” exclaimed the chap in
knickerbockers, who was so sharp and curious
that he was always called “Busy Izzy” Phelps.
“Where have you been all the time? We were
going to send a searching party after you.”
</p>
<p>
“You needn’t mind, sir. I can find my way
around a bit yet,” laughed Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“All ready, now!” exclaimed Bob, importantly,
from the high seat. “Can’t keep these
horses standing much longer.”
</p>
<p>
“All right, little boy,” said his sister, marshaling
the girls down the steps of the hotel. “Don’t
you be impatient.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s the horses,” he complained. “See that
nigh leader beginning to dance?”
</p>
<p>
“Tangoing, I suppose?—or is it the hesitation?”
laughed Lluella Fairfax. “May anybody
sit up there beside you, Mr. Bob?”
</p>
<p>
“I’m afraid not. But there’s room on top of
the coach for all of you, if you’ll crowd a bit.”
</p>
<p>
“Me behind with the horn!” cried Tom,
swinging himself up into the little seat over the
luggage rack.
</p>
<p>
“Now, girls, there are some steep places on
the road,” said Madge. “If any of you feel
nervous, I advise you to come inside with me.”
</p>
<p>
“Ha!” ejaculated Heavy. “It’s not my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>
nerves that keep me from climbing up on that
thing—don’t think it. But I’ll willingly join you,
Madge,” and the springs creaked, while the girls
laughed, as Heavy entered the coach.
</p>
<p>
They were all quickly seated—the boys of
course riding on the roof. Ruth, Helen, Lluella
and Belle occupied the seat directly behind the
driver. Jane Ann Hicks, who had been spending
the intervening week since school closed with
Heavy, and would return to Montana after their
sojourn at Sunrise Farm, was the only other girl
who ventured to ride a-top the coach.
</p>
<p>
“All ready?” sang out Bobbins, with a backward
glance.
</p>
<p>
Tom put the long silver horn to his lips and
blew a blast that startled the Darrowtown echoes,
and made the frisky nigh leader prance again.
Bob curled the long lash of the yellow whip over
the horses’ ears, and at the crack of it all four
plunged forward.
</p>
<p>
There was a crowd to see the party off. Darrowtown
had not become familiar with the
Steeles’ yellow coach. In fact, there were not
many wealthy men’s estates around the town as
yet, and such “goings-on” as this coaching party
of girls and boys was rather startling to the
staid inhabitants of Darrowtown.
</p>
<p>
The road through the town proper was very
good, and the heavy coach wheels rolled over it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>
smoothly. As soon as they reached the suburbs,
however, the way was rough, and the horses
began to climb, for Darrowtown was right at the
foot of the hills, on the very highest of which
Sunrise Farm lay.
</p>
<p>
There were farms here and there along the
way, but there was a great deal of rough country,
too. Although it was a warm day, those on
top of the coach were soon well shaded by the
trees. The road wound through a thick piece of
wood, where the broad-branched trees overhung
the way and—sometimes—almost brushed the
girls from their seats.
</p>
<p>
“Low bridge!” called Bobbins, now and
again, and they would all squeal and stoop while
the leafy branches brushed above them.
</p>
<p>
Bobbins had been practicing a good deal, so
as to have the honor of driving his friends home
from Darrowtown, and they all praised him for
being so capable.
</p>
<p>
As for Tom, he grew red in the face blowing
that horn to warn the foxes in the hills and the
rabbits in the bushes that they were coming.
</p>
<p>
“You look out, Tommy!” advised Madge
from below. “You’ll blow yourself all away
tooting so much, and goodness knows, we don’t
want any accident before luncheon. Mother is
expecting all manner of things to happen to us
after we get to the farm; but I promised faithfully
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>
I’d bring you all home to one o’clock luncheon
in perfect order.”
</p>
<p>
“A whole lot you’ve got to do with it,”
grunted Busy Izzy, ungallantly. “It’s Bobbins
that’s doing the chief work.”
</p>
<p>
Three hours to Sunrise Farm, yet it was only
fifteen miles. The way was not always uphill, but
the descents were as hard to get over as the rising
ground, and the coach rolled and shook a
good deal over the rougher places.
</p>
<p>
Bye and bye they began to look down into the
valleys from the steeps the horses climbed. At
one place was a great horseshoe curve, around
which the four steeds rattled at a smart pace,
skirting a precipice, the depth of which made the
girls shriek again.
</p>
<p>
“I never did see such a road,” complained
Lluella.
</p>
<p>
“We saw worse at Silver Ranch—didn’t we,
Ann?” demanded Ruth of the Montana girl.
</p>
<p>
“Well, this is bad enough, I should hope,”
said Belle Tingley. “Lucky there is a good brake
on this coach. Where’d we be——?”
</p>
<p>
As it chanced, the coach had just pitched over
the brow of another ridge. Bob had been about
to point out proudly the white walls of the house
at Sunrise Farm which surmounted the next hill.
</p>
<p>
But there had been a rain within a week, and
a hard one. Right here there was a small washout in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>
the road, and Bob overlooked it. He did
not swerve the trotting horses quickly enough,
and the nigh fore-wheel dropping into this deep,
deep rut.
</p>
<p>
It is true Bob became a little excited. He
yelled “Whoa!” and yanked back on the lines,
for the nigh leader had jumped. The girls
screamed as the coach came to an abrupt stop.
</p>
<p>
The four horses were jerked back by the sudden
stoppage; then, frightened, they all leaped
forward together.
</p>
<p>
“Whoa, there!” yelled Bob again, trying to
hold them in. Something broke and the nigh
leader swung around until he was at right angles
with his team-mate.
</p>
<p>
The leader had snapped a tug; he forced his
mate over toward the far side of the road; and
there the ground broke away, abruptly and steeply,
for many, many yards to the bottom of the
hill.
</p>
<p>
There was neither fence, nor ditch, to guard
passengers on the road from catastrophe.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span><a name='chX' id='chX'></a>CHAPTER X—“TOUCH AND GO”</h2>
<p>
As it chanced, Mr. Steele’s groom, who had
been sent with the coach and who sat beside Bob,
was on the wrong side to give any assistance at
this crucial moment. To have jumped from the
seat threatened to send him plunging down the
undefended hillside—perhaps with the coach rolling
after him!
</p>
<p>
For some seconds it did seem as though the
horses would go down in a tangle and drag the
coach and its occupants after them.
</p>
<p>
Bob was doing his best with the reins, but the
frisky nigh leader was dancing and plunging, and
forcing his mate off the firm footing of the road.
Indeed, the latter animal was already slipping
over the brink.
</p>
<p>
“Get him!” yelled Bob, meaning the horse
that had broken the trace and had stirred up
all the trouble.
</p>
<p>
But who was to “get him”? That was the
difficulty. The groom could not climb over the
young driver to reach the ground.
</p>
<p>
There was at least one quick-witted person
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>
aboard the Sunrise coach in this “touch and go”
emergency. Ruth was not afraid of horses. She
had not been used to them, like Ann Hicks, all
her life, but she was the person now in the best
position to help Bob.
</p>
<p>
To reach the ground on the nigh side of the
coach Ann Hicks would have to climb over a
couple of boys. Ruth was on that end of the seat
and she swung herself off smartly, and landed
firmly on the road.
</p>
<p>
“Look out, Ruth!” shrieked her chum,
“you’ll be killed!”
</p>
<p>
Ruth had no intention of getting near the heels
of the horse that had broken its harness. She
darted around to his head and seized his bridle.
His mate was already scattering gravel down the
hillside as he plunged.
</p>
<p>
Ruth, paying no attention to the shrieks of
the girls or the commands of the groom and
the boys, jerked the nigh horse’s head around,
and so gave his mate a chance to obtain firm footing
again. She instantly led both horses toward
the inside of the road.
</p>
<p>
Tom was off his perch by now and had dashed
forward to her aid. Amid the gabble of the
others, they seemed the only two cool persons
in the party.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! hold them tight, Tom!” cried his sister.
“Don’t let them run.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>
</p>
<p>
“Pshaw! they don’t want to run,” growled
Bobbins.
</p>
<p>
The groom climbed carefully over him and
leaped down into the road. Tom was looking at
Ruth with shining eyes.
</p>
<p>
“You’re the girl for me, Ruthie,” he whispered
in a sudden burst of enthusiasm. “I never
saw one like you. You always have your wits
about you.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth smiled and blushed. A word of approbation
from Tom Cameron was sweeter to her
than the praise of any other of her young friends.
She gave him a grateful look, and then turned
back to the coach, where the girls were still as
excited as a swarm of bees.
</p>
<p>
They all wanted to get down into the road,
until Madge positively forbade it, and Ruth
swung herself up to her seat again.
</p>
<p>
“You can’t do any good down there, and you’d
only be in the way,” Madge said. “And the
danger’s over now.”
</p>
<p>
“Thanks to Ruthie!” added Helen, squeezing
her chum.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, you make too much fuss about it,” said
Ruth. “I just grabbed the bridle.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” said Mercy, from inside. “I thought
I’d need my aeroplanes to fly with, when that
horse began to back over the edge of the hill.
You’re a good child, Ruthie. I always said so.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>
</p>
<p>
The others had more or less to say about
Ruth’s action and she was glad to turn the conversation
to some other subject.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile the groom had mended the harness,
and now he and Tom led the leaders to straighten
out the team, and the four horses threw themselves
into their collars and jerked the coach-wheel
out of the gutter.
</p>
<p>
The trouble had delayed them but slightly, and
soon Tom was cheerfully winding the horn, and
the horses were rattling down a more gentle
descent into the last valley.
</p>
<p>
From this to the top of the hill on which the
Steele home stood was a steady ascent and the
horses could not go rapidly. Bob and Madge
pointed out the objects of interest as they rolled
along—the farmhouses that were to be torn
down, the fences already straightened, and the
dykes and walls on which Mr. Steele’s men were
at work.
</p>
<p>
“When this whole hill is father’s, you’ll see
some farm,” crowed Bobbins.
</p>
<p>
“But whose place is <em>that?</em>” demanded one of
the girls, behind him, suddenly.
</p>
<p>
The coach had swung around a turn in the road
where a great, bald rock and a border of trees
on the right hand, hid all that lay beyond on
this gentle slope. The other girls cried out at
the beauty of the scene.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>
</p>
<p>
A gable-roofed farmhouse, dazzlingly white,
with green blinds, stood end to the road. There
were great, wide-branched oaks all about it. The
sod was clipped close and looked like velvet. Yet
the surroundings of the homestead were rather
wild, as though Nature had scarcely been disturbed
by the hand of man since the original
clearing was made here in the hillside forest.
</p>
<p>
There were porches, and modern buildings and
“ells” added to the great old house, but the two
huge chimneys, one at either end, pronounced the
building to be of the architecture of the earliest
settlers in this section of the State.
</p>
<p>
There were beds of old-fashioned flowers;
there was a summerhouse on the lawn, covered
with vines; altogether it was a most beautiful
and “homey” looking place.
</p>
<p>
“Whose place is it?” repeated the questioner.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, that? Caslon’s,” grunted Bob. “He’s
the chap who won’t sell out to father. Mean old
thing.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, it’s a love of an old place!” exclaimed
Helen.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. It is the one house father was going to
let stand on the hill beside our own. You see,
we wanted to put our superintendent in it.”
</p>
<p>
Just then an old gentleman came out of the
summer house. He was a portly, gray mustached,
bald-headed man, in clean linen trousers and a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span>
white shirt with a short, starched bosom. He
wore no collar or necktie, but looked clean and
comfortable. He smiled at the young people on
the coach jovially.
</p>
<p>
Behind him stood a motherly lady some years
his junior. She was buxom and smiling, too.
</p>
<p>
Bobbins jerked his head around and snapped
his whip over the leaders’ ears. “These are the
people,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“Who?” asked Belle Tingley.
</p>
<p>
“The Caslons.”
</p>
<p>
“But they’re real nice looking people,” Helen
exclaimed, in wonder.
</p>
<p>
“Well, they’re a thorn—or a pair of thorns—in
my father’s flesh. You’d better not boost them
before him.”
</p>
<p>
“And they don’t want to sell their old home?”
queried Ruth, softly. Then to herself, she whispered:
“And who could blame them? I wouldn’t
sell it, either, if it were mine.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span><a name='chXI' id='chXI'></a>CHAPTER XI—TOBOGGANING IN JUNE</h2>
<p>
The four horses climbed briskly after that
and brought the yellow coach to an old stone
gateway. At the end of the Caslon farm the
stone wall had begun, and now it stretched ahead,
up over the rise, as far as anything was to be
seen. Indeed, it seemed to melt right into the sky.
</p>
<p>
Bobbins turned the leaders’ noses in at the
gateway. Already it was shown that the new
owner had begun to improve the estate. The
driveway was an example of what road-making
should be—entirely different from the hap-hazard
work done on the country roads.
</p>
<p>
There were beautiful pastures on either hand,
all fenced in with wire—“horse high, bull strong,
and pig tight,” as Bobbins explained, proudly.
There were horses in one pasture and a herd of
cows in another. Beyond, sheep dotted a rocky
bit of the hillside, and the thin, sweet “baa-as”
of the lambs came to their ears as the coach rolled
on.
</p>
<p>
The visitors were delighted. Every minute
they saw something to exclaim over. A pair of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>
beautifully spotted coach dogs raced down the
drive, and cavorted about the coach, eagerly welcoming
them.
</p>
<p>
When they finally topped the hill and came out
upon the tableland on which the house and the
main buildings of Sunrise Farm stood, they received
a welcome indeed.
</p>
<p>
There was a big farm bell hung to a creaking
arm in the water-tower beside the old colonial
dwelling. The instant the leaders’ ears
topped the rise, and while yet the coach was a
long way off, several youngsters swung themselves
on the bell-rope, and the alarm reverberated
across the hills and valleys in no uncertain tone.
</p>
<p>
Beside this, a cannon that was something
bigger than a toy, “spoke” loudly on the front
lawn, and a flag was run up the pole set here in a
prominent place before the house. Mr. and Mrs.
Steele stood on the broad veranda, between the
main pillars, to receive them, and when the coach
drew up with a flourish, the horde of younger
Steeles—Madge’s and Bob’s brothers and sisters,
whom the big sister called “steel filings”—charged
around from the bell-tower. There were
four or five of the younger children, all seemingly
about of an age, and they made as much confusion
as an army.
</p>
<p>
“Welcome to Sunrise, girls and boys,” said
Mr. Steele, who was a short, brisk, chubby man,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>
with an abrupt manner, but with an unmistakably
kind heart, or he would not have sanctioned the
descent of this horde of young folk upon the place.
“Welcome to Sunrise! We want you all to have
a good time here. The place is open to you, and
all Mother Steele begs is that you will not break
your necks or get into any other serious trouble.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Steele was much taller than her husband;
it was positive that Madge and Bobbins got their
height from her side of the family. All the
younger Steele seemed chubby and round like their
father.
</p>
<p>
Everybody seemed so jolly and kind that it
was quite surprising to see how the faces of both
Mother and Father Steele, as well as their children,
changed at the long lunch table, half an hour
later, when the name of Caslon, the neighboring
farmer, was mentioned.
</p>
<p>
“What d’ye think they have been telling me at
the stables, Pa?” cried Bobbins, when there was a
lull in the conversation so that he could be heard
from his end of the table to his father’s seat.
</p>
<p>
“I can’t say. What?” responded Mr. Steele.
</p>
<p>
“About those Caslons. What do you suppose
they’re going to do now?”
</p>
<p>
“Ha!” exclaimed the gentleman, his face
darkening. “Nothing you have heard could surprise
me.”
</p>
<p>
“I bet this does,” chuckled Bob. “They are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>
going to take a whole raft of fresh air kids to
board. What do you know about that? Little
ragamuffins from some school, or asylum, or hospital,
or something. Won’t they make a mess all
over this hill?”
</p>
<p>
“Ha! he’s done that to spite me,” exclaimed
Mr. Steele. “But I’ll post my line next to his,
and if those young ones trespass, I’ll see what my
lawyer in Darrowtown can do about it.”
</p>
<p>
“It shows what kind of people those Caslons
are,” said Mrs. Steele, with a sigh. “Of course,
they know such a crowd of children will be very
annoying to the neighbors.”
</p>
<p>
“And we’re the only neighbors,” added
Bob.
</p>
<p>
“Seems to me,” said Madge, slowly, “that I
have heard the Caslons always <em>do</em> take a bunch of
fresh air children in the summer.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I fancy he is doing it this year just to
spite us,” said her father, shortly. “But I’ll
show him——”
</p>
<p>
He became gloomy, and a cloud seemed to fall
upon the whole table for the remainder of the
meal. It was evident that nothing the neighboring
farmer could do would be looked upon with
favorable eyes by the Steeles.
</p>
<p>
Ruth did not comment upon the situation, as
some of the other girls did out of hearing of
their hosts. It <em>did</em> seem too bad that the Steeles
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span>
should drag this trouble with a neighbor into the
public eye so much.
</p>
<p>
The girl of the Red Mill could not help but
remember the jovial looking old farmer and
his placid wife, and she felt sure they were
not people who would deliberately annoy their
neighbors. Yet, the Steeles had taken such a dislike
to the Caslons it was evident they could see
no good in the old farmer and his wife.
</p>
<p>
The Steeles had come directly from the city and
had brought most of their servants with them
from their city home. They had hired very few
local men, even on the farm. Therefore they
were not at all in touch with their neighbors, or
with any of the “natives.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Steele was a city man, through and
through. He had not even lived in the country
when he was a boy. His own children knew
much more about out-of-doors than he, or his
wife.
</p>
<p>
The host was a very successful business
man, had made money of late years, and wished
to spend some of his gains now in laying out the
finest “gentleman’s farm” in that quarter of the
State. To be balked right at the start by what
he called “a cowhide-booted old Rube” was a
cross that Mr. Steele could not bear with composure.
</p>
<p>
The young folks, naturally (save Ruth), were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>
not much interested in the controversy between
their hosts and the neighboring farmer. There
was too much fun going on for both girls and
boys to think of much beside.
</p>
<p>
That afternoon they overran the house and
stables, numbered the sheep, watched the tiny
pigs and their mothers in the clover-lot, were
delighted with the colts that ran with their mothers
in the paddock, played with the calves, and
got acquainted in general with the livestock of
Sunrise Farm.
</p>
<p>
“Only we haven’t goats,” said Bobbins. “I’ve
been trying to get father to buy some Angoras.
Old Caslon has the best stock anywhere around,
and father says he won’t try to buy of <em>him</em>. I’d
like to send off for a good big billy-goat and turn
him into Caslon’s back pasture. I bet there’d be
a fight, for Caslon’s got a billy that’ll chase you
just as soon as he’d wink.”
</p>
<p>
“We’d better keep out of <em>that</em> pasture, then,”
laughed one of the girls.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, father’s forbidden us trespassing on
Caslon’s land. We’d like to catch him on <em>our</em>
side of the line, that’s all!”
</p>
<p>
“Who—Mr. Caslon, or the billy?” asked
Tom, chuckling.
</p>
<p>
“Either one,” said Bob, shaking his head
threateningly.
</p>
<p>
Everyone was in bed early that night, for all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span>
were tired; but the boys had a whispered colloquy
before they went to sleep in their own big room
at the top of the house, and Bob tied a cord to
his big toe and weighted the other end so that
it would drop out of the window and hang just
about head-high above the grass.
</p>
<p>
The first stableman up about the place ran over
from the barns and gave Master Bob’s cord a
yank, according to instructions, and pretty nearly
hauled that ingenious chap out of bed before
the eastern sky was even streaked with light.
</p>
<p>
“Gee! have we got to get up now?” demanded
Busy Izzy, aroused, as were the other boys, by
Bobbins dancing about the floor and rubbing his
toe. “Somebody has been foolin’ you—it’s nowheres
near morning.”
</p>
<p>
“Bet a dog jumped up and bit that string you
hung out of the window,” chuckled Tom Cameron.
</p>
<p>
He looked at his watch and saw that it really
was after four o’clock.
</p>
<p>
“Come on, then!” Tom added, rolling Ralph
Tingley out of bed. “We must do as we said,
and surprise the girls.”
</p>
<p>
“Sh!” commanded Bobbins. “No noise. We
want to slide out easy.”
</p>
<p>
With much muffled giggling and wrestling,
they dressed and made their way downstairs.
The maids were just astir.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>
</p>
<p>
The boys had something particular to do, and
they went to work at it very promptly, under
Tom Cameron’s leadership. Behind one of the
farther barns was a sharp, but smooth slope, well
sodded, which descended to the line of the farm
that adjoined Mr. Caslon’s. There, at the bottom,
the land sloped up again to the stone wall
that divided the two estates.
</p>
<p>
It was a fine place for a slide in winter,
somebody had said; but Tom’s quick wit suggested
that it would be a good place for a slide
in summer, too! And the boys had laid their
plans for this early morning job accordingly.
</p>
<p>
Before breakfast they had built a dozen barrel-stave
toboggans—each long enough to hold two
persons, if it was so desired.
</p>
<p>
Tom and Bobbins tried them first and showed
the crowd how fine a slide it really was down the
long, grassy bank. The most timid girl in the
crowd finally was convinced that it was safe, and
for several hours, the shrieks of delight and
laughter from that hillside proved that a sport
out of season was all the better appreciated because
it was novel.
</p>
<p>
Over the broad stone wall was the pasture in
which Caslon kept his flock of goats. Beautiful,
long-haired creatures they were, but the solemn
old leader of the flock stamped his feet at the
curious girls and boys who looked over the wall,
and shook his horns.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>
</p>
<p>
Somewhere, along by the boundary of the two
estates, Bob said there was a spring, and Ruth
and Helen slipped off by themselves to find it. A
wild bit of brush pasture soon hid them from the
view of their friends, and as they went over a
small ridge and down into the deeper valley, the
laughter and shouting of those at the slide gradually
died away behind them.
</p>
<p>
The girls had to cross the stone wall to get at
the spring, and they did not remember that in
doing so they were “out of bounds.” Bob had
said nothing about the spring being on the Caslon
side of the boundary.
</p>
<p>
Once beside the brook, Helen must needs
explore farther. There were lovely trees and
flowering bushes, and wild strawberries in a small
meadow that lured the two girls on. They were
a long way from the stone fence when, of a sudden,
a crashing in the bushes behind them brought
both Ruth and Helen to their feet.
</p>
<p>
“My! what’s that?” demanded Helen.
</p>
<p>
“Sounds like some animal.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth’s remark was not finished.
</p>
<p>
“The goat! it’s the old billy!” sang out
Helen, and turned to run as the horned head of
the bewhiskered leader of the Angora herd came
suddenly into view.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span><a name='chXII' id='chXII'></a>CHAPTER XII—A NUMBER OF INTRODUCTIONS</h2>
<p>
“We must run, Ruthie!” Helen declared, instantly.
“Now, there’s no use in our trying to
face down that goat. Discretion is the better
part of valor—— Oh!”
</p>
<p>
The goat just then shook his horns and charged.
Ruth was not much behind her chum. She saw
before Helen, however, that they were running
right away from the Steele premises.
</p>
<p>
“We’re getting deeper and deeper into
trouble, Helen,” she panted. “Don’t you <em>see?</em>”
</p>
<p>
“I can’t see much. Oh! there’s a tree we can
both climb, I am sure.”
</p>
<p>
“But I don’t want to climb a tree,” objected
Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“All right. You stay down and play tag with
Mr. Billy Goat. Me for the high and lofty!”
and she sprang up as she spoke and clutched the
low limb of a widely branching cedar.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll never leave my pal!” Ruth declared, giggling,
and jumping for another limb.
</p>
<p>
Both girls had practiced on the ladders in the
school gymnasium and they quickly swung themselves
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>
up into the tree. The goat arrived almost
on the instant, too. At once he leaped up with
his fore-feet against the bole of the tree.
</p>
<p>
“My goodness me!” gasped Helen. “He’s
going to climb it, too.”
</p>
<p>
“You know goats <em>can</em> climb. They’re very
sure-footed,” said her chum.
</p>
<p>
“I know all that,” admitted Helen. “But I
didn’t suppose they could climb trees.”
</p>
<p>
The goat gave up <em>that</em> attempt, however, very
soon. He had no idea, it seemed, of going away
and leaving his treed victims in peace.
</p>
<p>
He paced around and around the cedar, casting
wicked glances at the girls’ dangling feet, and
shaking his horns in a most threatening way.
What he would do to them if he got a chance
would “be a-plenty,” Helen declared.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you suppose he’ll get tired, bye and
bye?” queried her chum, despondently.
</p>
<p>
“He doesn’t look as though he ever got
wearied,” returned Helen. “What a savage
looking beast he is! And such whiskers!”
</p>
<p>
“I wouldn’t make fun of him,” advised Ruth,
timidly. “I believe he understands—and it
makes him madder! Oh! see him!”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Goat, impatient of the delay, suddenly
charged the tree and banged against it with his
horns in a desperate attempt to jar down the
girls perched above.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, the foolish billy!” cooed Helen. “We’re
not ripe enough to drop off so easily. But he
thinks we are.”
</p>
<p>
“You can laugh,” complained Ruth. “But I
don’t think this is much fun.”
</p>
<p>
“Not for the goat, anyway. He is getting so
angry that he may have apoplexy. Let’s shout.
Maybe the boys will hear us.”
</p>
<p>
“Not ‘way down here, I fear,” returned Ruth.
“We can’t hear a sound from <em>them</em>. But let’s
try.”
</p>
<p>
They raised their voices in unison, again and
again. But there came no reply, save that a
number of Mr. Billy Goat’s lady friends came
trooping through the brush and looked up at the
girls perched so high above them.
</p>
<p>
“Bla-a-a-t! bla-a-a-at!” quoth the chorus of
nannies.
</p>
<p>
“The same to you, and many of them!” replied
Helen, bowing politely.
</p>
<p>
“Look out! you’ll fall from the limb,” advised
Ruth, much worried.
</p>
<p>
“And what a fall would then be there, my
countrymen!” sighed Helen. “Say, Ruth! did
you ever notice before what an expressive countenance
a goat has? Now, Mr. Billy, here, looks
just like a selectman of a country school board—long
whiskers and all.”
</p>
<p>
“You stop making fun of him,” declared
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>
Ruth, shaking her head. “I tell you it makes
him mad.”
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Goaty,&nbsp;&nbsp;goaty,&nbsp;&nbsp;go&nbsp;&nbsp;away,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come&nbsp;&nbsp;again&nbsp;&nbsp;some&nbsp;&nbsp;other&nbsp;&nbsp;day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ruthie&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;Helen&nbsp;&nbsp;want&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;get&nbsp;&nbsp;down&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;play!”<br />
</p>
<p>
sang Helen Cameron, with a most ridiculous
expression.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll never get down unless somebody comes
to drive that beast away,” cried Ruth, in disgust.
</p>
<p>
“And I bet nobody comes over to this end
of the farm for days at a time.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s it! keep on! make it just as bad as
you can,” groaned Ruth. “Do you know it will
soon be luncheon time, Helen?”
</p>
<p>
“But that won’t bother Mr. Goat. He hopes
to lunch off us, I guess.”
</p>
<p>
“But we can’t stay here, Helen!” cried Ruth,
in despair.
</p>
<p>
“You have my permission to hop right down,
my dear, and make the closer acquaintance of Sir
Capricornus, and all the harem. Ex-cuse me! I
think after due consideration I will retain my lofty
perch—— Ugh!”
</p>
<p>
“You came pretty near slipping off that time!”
exclaimed Ruth. “I wouldn’t be too funny, if I
were you.”
</p>
<p>
“Maybe you are right,” agreed her friend, in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>
a more subdued tone. “Dear me! let us call
again, Ruth!”
</p>
<p>
So both girls again raised their voices. This
time there was a response, but not from the direction
of the stone wall they had crossed to reach
the spring.
</p>
<p>
“Hello!” called a jovial sounding voice.
“Hello up there!”
</p>
<p>
“Hello yourself!” shouted Helen. “Oh, do,
<em>do</em> come and drive away these awful goats.”
</p>
<p>
There was a hearty laugh at this reply, and
then a man appeared. Ruth had guessed his
identity before ever he came in view. It was the
portly Mr. Caslon.
</p>
<p>
“Well, well, my dears! how long have you
been roosting up there?” he demanded, laughing
frankly at them. “Get out, you rascal!”
</p>
<p>
This he said to the big goat, who started for
him with head lowered. Mr. Caslon leaped
nimbly to one side and whacked the goat savagely
across the back with his knobby stick. The
goat kept right on down the hillside, evidently
having had enough of <em>that</em> play, and the nannies
followed, bleating.
</p>
<p>
“You can come down now, young ladies,” said
the farmer. “But I wouldn’t come over into this
pasture to play much. The goats don’t like
strangers.”
</p>
<p>
“We had no business to come here at all, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>
we forgot,” explained Ruth, when both she and
her chum had descended from the tree. “We
were warned not to come over on this side of the
line.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, indeed? you’re from up on the hill-top?”
he asked.
</p>
<p>
“We are visiting Madge Steele—yes,” said
Helen, looking at him curiously.
</p>
<p>
“Ah! I saw all you young folk going by
yesterday. You should have a fine time about
here,” said the farmer, smiling broadly. “And,
aside from the temper of the goats, I don’t mind
you all coming over here on my land if you like.”
</p>
<p>
The girls thanked him warmly for rescuing
them from their predicament, and then ran up
the hill to put the stone wall between them and
the goats before there was more trouble.
</p>
<p>
“I like him,” said Helen, referring to Mr.
Caslon.
</p>
<p>
“So do I,” agreed Ruth. “And it’s too bad
that Mr. Steele and he do not understand each
other.”
</p>
<p>
Although their escapade with the goats was a
good joke—and a joke worth telling to the
crowd—Ruth decided that it would be just as
well to say nothing about it, and she told Helen
so.
</p>
<p>
“I expect you are right,” admitted her chum.
“It will only cause comment because we went
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>
out of bounds, and became acquainted with Mr.
Caslon. But I’m glad the old goat introduced
us,” and she laughed and tossed her head.
</p>
<p>
So they joined their friends, who had gotten
tired by this time of tobogganing in June, and
they all trooped up the hill again to the house.
It was growing warm, and the hammocks and
lounging chairs in the shade of the verandas attracted
them until noon.
</p>
<p>
After luncheon there was tennis and croquet
on the lawns, and toward evening everybody went
driving, although not in the yellow coach this
time.
</p>
<p>
The plans for the following day included a
long drive by coach to a lake beyond Darrowtown,
where they had a picnic lunch, and boated
and fished and had a glorious time in general.
</p>
<p>
Bobbins drove as before, but there were two
men with the party to do the work and look
after the horses, and Mrs. Steele herself was
present to have an oversight of the young folk.
</p>
<p>
Bob Steele was very proud of his ability to
drive the four-in-hand, and when they swung
through Darrowtown on the return trip, with the
whip cracking and Tom tooting the horn, many
people stopped to observe the passing of the
turnout.
</p>
<p>
Every other team got out of their way—even
the few automobiles they passed. But when they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>
got over the first ridge beyond the town and the
four horses broke into a canter, Mrs. Steele, who
sat up behind her son on this journey, suddenly
put a hand upon his shoulder and called his
attention to something ahead in the road.
</p>
<p>
“Do have a care, my son,” she said. “There
has been an accident there—yes? Don’t drive
too fast——”
</p>
<p>
“By jiminy!” ejaculated Ralph Tingley.
“That’s a breakdown, sure enough.”
</p>
<p>
“A farm wagon. There’s a wheel off,” cried
Ann Hicks, leaning out from the other end of
the seat the better to see.
</p>
<p>
“And who are all those children in blue?”
demanded Mercy Curtis, looking out from below.
“There’s such a lot of them! One, two, three,
four, five—— Goodness me! they jump about
so like fleas that I can’t count them!”
</p>
<p>
“Why, I bet I know what it is,” drawled Bobbins,
at last. “It’s old Caslon and his load of
fresh airs. He was going to town to meet them
to-day, I believe. And he’s broken down before
he’s half way home with them—and serves him
good and right!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span><a name='chXIII' id='chXIII'></a>CHAPTER XIII—“THE TERRIBLE TWINS”</h2>
<p>
Ruth heard Bob’s last expression, despite the
rattling of the harness and the chattering of the
girls on, and in, the coach, and she was sorry.
Yet, could he be blamed so much, when similar
feelings were expressed daily by his own father
regarding the Caslons?
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Steele was shocked as well. “My dear
son!” she exclaimed, in a low voice, leaning over
his shoulder. “Be careful of your tongue. Don’t
say things for which you might be sorry—indeed,
for which I am sure you <em>are</em> sorry when you stop
to think.”
</p>
<p>
“Huh! Isn’t that old Caslon as mean as he
can be?” demanded Bobbins.
</p>
<p>
“I am sure,” the good lady sighed, “that I
wish he would agree to sell his place to your
father, and so have an end of all this talk and
worriment. But I am not at all sure that he
hasn’t a right to do as he pleases with his own
property.”
</p>
<p>
“Well—now—Mother——”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>
</p>
<p>
But she stopped him with: “At any rate, you
must halt and offer him help. And those children—I
hope none of them has been hurt.”
</p>
<p>
“Pooh! you couldn’t hurt kids like those,” declared
Bob.
</p>
<p>
But he brought the horses down to a walk and
the yellow coach approached the scene of the accident
at a temperate pace.
</p>
<p>
The big farm-wagon, the body of which had
been filled with straw for the youngsters to ride
in, had been pulled to the side of the road out
of the way of passing vehicles. It was clear that
the smashed wheel was past repair by any amateur
means, for several spokes were broken, and
the hub was split.
</p>
<p>
The youngsters whom Mr. Caslon had taken
aboard at the railway station in Darrowtown
were dancing about and yelling like wild Indians.
As the coach came nearer, the excited party upon
it could more carefully count the blue-clad figures,
and it was proved that there were twelve.
</p>
<p>
Six girls were in blue gingham frocks, all alike,
and all made “skimpy” and awkward looking.
The six boys were in new blue overalls and cotton
shirts. The overalls seemed all of one size, although
the boys were not. They must have been
purchased at the store of one size, and whether
a boy was six, or twelve, he wore the same number.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>
</p>
<p>
Each of the children, too, carried a more or
less neatly made up parcel, the outer covering
of which was a blue and white bandanna, and
the contents of which was the change of clothing
the institution allowed them.
</p>
<p>
“What a terrible noise they make!” sighed
Mrs. Steele. “And they are perfect little terrors,
I suppose. But they <em>are</em> clean.”
</p>
<p>
They had not been out of the sight of the
institution nurse long enough to be otherwise, for
she had come as far as Darrowtown with them.
But they <em>were</em> noisy, sure enough, for each one
was trying to tell his or her mates how he or she
felt when the wheel crashed and the wagon went
over.
</p>
<p>
“I reckon I oughtn’t to have risked that wheel,
after all,” said Mr. Caslon, doffing his hat to
Mrs. Steele, but smiling broadly as he looked up
from his examination of the wheel.
</p>
<p>
“Whoa, Charlie! Don’t get too near them
heels, youngsters. Charlie an’ Ned are both old
duffers like me; but you can’t fool around a
horse’s legs without making him nervous.
</p>
<p>
“And don’t pull them reins. I don’t want ’em
to start right now.... Yes, ma’am. I’ll haf
ter lead the horses home, and that I don’t mind.
But these young ones—— Now, let that whip
lay right where it is, young man! That’s right.
</p>
<p>
“You see, ma’am,” he proceeded, quite calmly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>
despite all that was going on about him, and addressing
himself to Mrs. Steele, “it’s too long a
walk for the little ones, and I couldn’t tote ’em
all on the backs of the horses——
</p>
<p>
“Now, you two curly heads there—what do
you call ’em?”
</p>
<p>
“The Terrible Twins!” quoth two or three
of the other orphans, in chorus.
</p>
<p>
“I believe ye! I believe ye! They jest bile
over, <em>they</em> do. Now, you two boys,” he added,
addressing two youngsters, very much alike,
about of a height, and both with short, light curly
hair, “never mind tryin’ to unharness Charlie and
Ned. <em>I’ll</em> do that.
</p>
<p>
“Ye see, ma’am, if you could take some of
the little ones aboard——” he suggested to Mrs.
Steele.
</p>
<p>
The coach was well filled, yet it was not crowded.
The girls began to call to the little folks to
get aboard even before Mrs. Steele could
speak.
</p>
<p>
“There’s lots of room up here,” cried Ruth,
leaning from her end of the seat and offering her
hand. The twins ran at once to climb up and
fought for “first lift” by Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes! they can get aboard,” said Mrs.
Steele. “All there is room for.”
</p>
<p>
And the twelve “fresh airs” proved very
quickly that there was room for them all. Ruth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>
had the “terrible twins” on the seat with her in
half a minute, and the others swarmed into, or
on top of, the coach almost as quickly.
</p>
<p>
“There now! that’s a big lift, I do declare,”
said the farmer, hanging the chains of the horses’
traces upon the hames, and preparing to lead the
pair along the road.
</p>
<p>
“My wife will be some surprised, I bet,” and
he laughed jovially. “I’m certain sure obleeged
to ye, Mis’ Steele. Neighbors ought to be neighborly,
an’ you air doin’ me a good turn this
time—yes, ma’am!”
</p>
<p>
“Now, you see,” growled Bob, as the four
coach horses trotted on, “he’ll take advantage of
this. We’ve noticed him once, and he’ll always
be fresh.”
</p>
<p>
“Hush, my son!” whispered Mrs. Steele.
“Little pitchers have big ears.”
</p>
<p>
“Huh!” exclaimed one of the wriggling twins,
looking up at the lady sideways like a bird. “I
know what <em>that</em> means. <em>We’re</em> little pitchers—Dickie
an’ me. We’ve heard that before—ain’t
we, Dickie?”
</p>
<p>
“Yep,” announced his brother, nodding wisely.
</p>
<p>
These two were certainly wise little scamps!
Willie did most of the talking, but whatever he
said his brother agreed to. Dickie being so chary
with speech, possibly his brother felt that he must
exercise his own tongue the more, for he chattered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>
away like a veritable magpie, turning now and
then to demand:
</p>
<p>
“Ain’t that so, Dickie?”
</p>
<p>
“Yep,” vouchsafed the echo, and, thus championed,
Willie would rattle on again.
</p>
<p>
Yes. They was all from the same asylum.
There were lots more of boys and girls in that
same place. But only twelve could get to go
to this place where they were going. They knew
boys that went to Mr. Caslon’s last year.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t we, Dickie?”
</p>
<p>
“Yep.”
</p>
<p>
No. They didn’t have a mama or papa. Never
had had any. But they had a sister. She was a
big girl and had gone away from the asylum.
Some time, when they were big enough, they were
going to run away from the asylum and find her.
</p>
<p>
“Ain’t we, Dickie?”
</p>
<p>
“Yep.”
</p>
<p>
Whether the other ten “fresh airs” were as
funny and cute as the “terrible twins,” or not,
Ruth Fielding did not know, but both she and
Mrs. Steele were vastly amused by them, and
continued to be so all the way to the old homestead
under the hill where the children had come
to spend a part of the summer with Mr. and
Mrs. Caslon.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span><a name='chXIV' id='chXIV'></a>CHAPTER XIV—“WHY! OF COURSE!”</h2>
<p>
“I hope you told that Caslon woman, Mother,
to keep those brats from boiling over upon our
premises,” said Mr. Steele, cheerfully, at dinner
that evening, when the story of the day’s adventures
was pretty well told.
</p>
<p>
“Really, John, I had no time. <em>Such</em> a crowd
of eels—— Well! whatever she may deserve,”
said Mrs. Steele, shaking her head, “I am sure
she does not deserve the trouble those fresh air
children will bring her. And she—she seems like
such a nice old lady.”
</p>
<p>
“Who’s a nice old lady?” demanded her husband,
from the other end of the long table, rather
sharply.
</p>
<p>
“Farmer Caslon’s wife.”
</p>
<p>
“Humph! I don’t know what she is; I know
what <em>he</em> is, however. No doubt of that. He’s
the most unreasonable——”
</p>
<p>
“Well, they’ll have their hands full with all
those young ones,” laughed Madge Steele, breaking
in upon her father, perhaps because she did
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>
not wish him to reveal any further to her guests
his ideas upon this topic.
</p>
<p>
“What under the sun can they do it for?” demanded
Lluella Fairfax.
</p>
<p>
“Just think of troubling one’s self with a
parcel of ill-bred children like those orphanage
kids,” added Belle Tingley.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, they do it just to bother the neighbors,
of course,” growled Bobbins, who naturally believed
all his father said, or thought, to be just
right.
</p>
<p>
“They take a world of trouble on themselves,
then, to spite their neighbors,” laughed Mercy
Curtis, in her sharp way. “That’s cutting one’s
nose off to spite one’s face, sure enough!”
</p>
<p>
“Goodness only knows <em>why</em> they do it,” began
Madge, when Ruth, who could keep in no longer,
now the topic had become generally discussed
among the young people, exclaimed:
</p>
<p>
“Both the farmer and his wife look to be
very kindly and jolly sort of people. I am sure
they have no idea of troubling other folk with
the children they take to board. They must be,
I think, very charitable, as well as very fond of
children.”
</p>
<p>
“Trust Ruth for seeing the best side of it,”
laughed Heavy.
</p>
<p>
“And the right side, too, I bet,” murmured
Tom Cameron.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>
</p>
<p>
“We’ll hope so,” said Mr. Steele, rather
grimly. “But if Caslon lets them trespass on
my land, he’ll hear about it, sharp and plenty!”
</p>
<p>
Now, it so happened, that not twenty-four
hours had passed before the presence of the
“fresh air kids” was felt upon the sacred premises
of Sunrise Farm. It was very hot that next
day, and the girls remained in the shade, or
played a desultory game of tennis, or two, or
knocked the croquet balls around a bit, refusing
to go tramping through the woods with the boys
to a pond where it was said the fish would
bite.
</p>
<p>
“So do the mosquitoes—I know them,” said
Mercy Curtis, when the boys started. “Be honest
about it, now; I bet you get ten mosquito bites
to every fish-bite. Tell us when you get back.”
</p>
<p>
Late in the afternoon the rural mail carrier
was due and Ruth, Helen, Madge and Heavy
started for the gate on the main road where the
Steeles had their letter box.
</p>
<p>
A little woolly dog ran after Madge—her
mother’s pet. “Come on, Toodles!” she said,
and then all four girls started to race with Toodles
down to the gate.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly Toodles spied something more entertaining
to bark at and caper about than the girls’
skirts. A cat was slipping through the bushes
beside the wall, evidently on the trail of some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>
unconscious bird. Toodles, uttering a glad “yap,
yap, yap!” started for the cat.
</p>
<p>
Two tousled, curly heads appeared at the gateway.
Below the uncapped heads were two thin
bodies just of a size, clothed in shirts and overalls
of blue.
</p>
<p>
“Hello, kiddies!” said Heavy. “How did
you get here?”
</p>
<p>
“On our feet—didn’t we, Dickie?” responded
Master Willie.
</p>
<p>
“Yep,” said Dickie.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear me! Toodles will hurt that cat!”
cried Madge. “One of you boys run and save
her—save kitty!” she begged.
</p>
<p>
But as the youngsters started off as per direction,
the cat turned savagely upon Toodles. She
snarled like a wildcat, leaped for his fur-covered
back, and laid in with her claws in a way that
made the pup yell with fright and pain.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, never mind the cat! Help Toodles!
Help Toodles!” wailed Madge, seeing her pet in
such dire trouble.
</p>
<p>
The youngsters stopped with disgust, as Toodles
went kiting up the hill, yelping.
</p>
<p>
“Pshaw!” exclaimed Willie. “Toodles don’t
need helpin’. Did’ye ever see such a dog? What
he needs is a nurse—don’t he, Dickie?”
</p>
<p>
“Yep,” declared the oracular Dickie, with emphasis.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>
</p>
<p>
Heavy dropped down on the grass and rolled.
As the cat had quickly returned from the chase,
Madge and Helen joined her. It was too funny.
The “terrible twins” were just slipping out of
the gate, when Ruth called to them.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t go yet, boys. Are you having a good
time?”
</p>
<p>
“We ain’t allowed in here,” said Willie.
</p>
<p>
“Who told you so?”
</p>
<p>
“The short, fat man with the squinty eyes and
the cane,” declared Willie, in a matter of fact
way.
</p>
<p>
“Short—fat—squinty—— My goodness! I
wonder if he can mean my father?” exclaimed
Madge, inclined to be offended.
</p>
<p>
“But you can stand there and talk with us,”
said Ruth, strolling toward the boys. “So you
are having a nice time at Mr. Caslon’s?”
</p>
<p>
“Bully—ain’t we, Dickie?”
</p>
<p>
“Yep,” agreed the echo.
</p>
<p>
“And you won’t be glad to go back to the orphanage
when you have to leave here?”
</p>
<p>
“Say, who ever was glad to go to a ’sylum?”
demanded Willie, with scorn.
</p>
<p>
“And you can’t remember any other home,
either of you?” asked Ruth, with pity.
</p>
<p>
“Huh! we ’member just the same things. Our
ages is just alike, they be,” said Willie, with
scorn.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>
</p>
<p>
“They have you there, Ruth,” chuckled Heavy.
</p>
<p>
Ruth Fielding was really interested in the two
youngsters. “And you are all alone in the
world?” she pursued.
</p>
<p>
“Nope. We gotter sister.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! so you said.”
</p>
<p>
“And it’s so, too. She used ter be at the
’sylum,” explained Willie. “But they sent her
off to live with somebody. And we was tried out
by a lady and a gentleman, too; but we was too
much work for the lady. We made too much
extry washin’,” said Willie, solemnly.
</p>
<p>
“My goodness me!” exclaimed Ruth, suddenly.
“What are your names?”
</p>
<p>
“I’m Willie; he’s Dickie.”
</p>
<p>
“But Willie and Dickie <em>what</em>?” demanded the
startled Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“No, ma’am. It ain’t that. It’s Raby,” declared
the youngster, coolly. “And our sister,
<em>she’s</em> Sadie Raby. She’s awful smart and some
day, she told us, she’s goin’ to come an’ steal us
from the ‘sylum, and then we’ll all live together
and keep house.”
</p>
<p>
“Will you hear this, Helen?” demanded
Ruth, eagerly, to her chum who had run to her.
</p>
<p>
“Why, of course! we might have known as
much, if we had been smart. These are the twins
Sadie told you about. And we never guessed!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span><a name='chXV' id='chXV'></a>CHAPTER XV—THE TEMPEST</h2>
<p>
Ruth was much interested in the fresh air children,
and so was Helen. They found time to
walk down to the Caslon farm and become acquainted
with the entire twelve. Naturally, the
“terrible twins” held their attention more than
the others, for it <em>did</em> seem so strange that the
little brothers of Sadie Raby should come across
Ruth’s path in just this way.
</p>
<p>
Of course, in getting so well acquainted with
the children, Ruth and her chum were bound to
know the farmer and his wife better. They were
very plain, “homey” sort of people, just as
Ruth had guessed, and it appeared that they were
not blessed with an over-abundance of ready
money. Few farmers in Mr. Caslon’s circumstances
are.
</p>
<p>
What means they had, they joyfully divided
with the youngsters they had taken to board. The
Caslons had no living children; indeed, the two
they had had, years ago, died while they were
yet babies. This Mrs. Caslon confided to Ruth.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>
</p>
<p>
“It left an empty place in our hearts,” she said,
softly, “that nothing but other little children can
fill. John has missed them fully as much as I
have. Yes; he lets these little harum-scarums
pull him around, and climb all over him, and
interfere with his work, and take up his time a
good deal. Yes, I know the place looks a sight,
inside the house and out, when they go away.
</p>
<p>
“But for a few weeks every year we have a
host of young things about us, and it keeps our
hearts young. The bother of ’em, and the trouble
of ’em, is nothing to the good they do us both.
Ah, yes!
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I’ve often thought of keeping one or
two of them for good. There’s a-many pretty
ones, or cunning ones, we’d like to have had. But
then—think of the disappointment of the rest of
the darlings!
</p>
<p>
“And it would have narrowed down our sympathy—mine
and John’s,” proceeded Mrs. Caslon,
shaking her head gently. “We’d have centered
all our love and longin’ into them we took
for keeps, just as we centered all our interest in
the two little ones God lent us for a little while,
long ago.
</p>
<p>
“Havin’ a number of ’em each year, and almost
always different ones, has been better, I
guess—better for all hands. It keeps John and
me interested more, and we try to make them so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>
happy here that each poor, unfortunate orphan
will go away and remember his or her summer
here for the rest of their lives.
</p>
<p>
“And they <em>do</em> have so little to be happy over,
these orphans—and it takes so very little to make
them happy.
</p>
<p>
“If I had money—much money,” continued
the farmer’s wife, clasping her hands, fervently,
“I’d move many orphan asylums, and such like,
out of the close, hot cities, where the little ones
are cramped for room and air, and put each of
them on a farm—a great, big farm. City’s no
place for children to grow up—’specially those
that have no fathers and mothers.
</p>
<p>
“You can’t tell me but that these young ones
miss their parents less here on this farm than
they do back in the brick building they live in
most of the year,” concluded the good woman,
earnestly.
</p>
<p>
Ruth quite fell in love with the old lady—who
did not appear so very old, after all. Perhaps
she had kept her heart young in serving these
“fresh air” orphans, year after year. And Mr.
Caslon seemed a very happy, jolly sort of man,
too.
</p>
<p>
The two girls stole away quite frequently to
watch the youngsters play, or to teach them new
means of entertaining themselves, or to talk with
the farmer’s wife. But they did not wish the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>
other girls, and the Steeles, to know where they
went on these occasions.
</p>
<p>
Their host, who was the nicest kind of a man
in every other way, seemed determined to look
upon Caslon as his enemy; and Mr. Steele was
ready to do anything he could to oust the old
couple from their home.
</p>
<p>
“Pshaw! a man like Caslon can make a good
living anywhere,” Mr. Steele declared. “His
crops just <em>grow</em> for him. He’s an A-1 farmer—I’d
like to find as good a one before next year,
to superintend my whole place. He’s just holding
out for a big price for his farm, that’s all he’s
doing. These hayseeds are money-mad, anyway.
I haven’t offered him enough for his old farm,
that’s all.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth doubted if this were true. The Caslon
place was one of the oldest homesteads in that
part of the State, and the house had been built
by a Caslon. Mr. Steele could not appreciate
the fact that there was a sentiment attached to
the farmer’s occupancy of his old home.
</p>
<p>
The Caslons had taken root here on this side-hill.
The farmer and his wife were the last of
the name; they had nobody to will it to. But
they loved every acre of the farm, and the city
man’s money did not look good enough to them.
</p>
<p>
Ruth Fielding hungered to straighten out the
tangle. She wished she might make Mr. Steele
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span>
understand the old farmer’s attitude. Was there
not, too, some way of settling the controversy in
a way satisfactory to both parties?
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile the merry party of young folk at
Sunrise Farm was busy every waking hour.
There were picnics, and fishing parties, and
games, and walks, and of course riding galore,
for Mr. Steele had plenty of horses.
</p>
<p>
Ruth and Helen privately worked up some
interest among the girls and boys visiting the
farm, in a celebration on the Fourth for the
fresh air children. Ruth had learned that the
farmer had purchased some cheap fireworks and
the like for the entertainment of the orphans;
but Ruth and her chum wanted to add to his
modest preparations.
</p>
<p>
Ten dollars was raised, and Tom Cameron
took charge of the fund. He was to ride into
town the afternoon before the Fourth to make the
purchases, but just about as he was to start, a
thunderstorm came up.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Steele, who was a nervous man, forbade
any riding or driving with that threatening cloud
advancing over the hills. The lightning played
sharply along the edges of the cloud and the
thunder rolled ominously.
</p>
<p>
“You youngsters don’t know what a tempest is
like here in the hills,” said Mr. Steele. “Into
the house—all of you. Take that horse and cart
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>
back to the stables, Jackson. If Tom wants to
go to town, he’ll have to wait until the shower
is over—or go to-morrow.”
</p>
<p>
“All right, sir,” agreed young Cameron, cheerfully.
“Just as you say.”
</p>
<p>
“Are all those girls inside?” sharply demanded
Mr. Steele. “I thought I saw the flutter
of a petticoat in the shrubbery yonder.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll see,” said Tom, running indoors.
</p>
<p>
Nervous Mr. Steele thought he saw somebody
there behind the bushes, before he heard from
Tom. It had already begun to rain in big drops,
and suddenly there was a flash of lightning and a
report seemingly right overhead.
</p>
<p>
The host turned up his coat collar, thrust
his cap over his ears, and ran out across the lawn
toward the path behind the shrubbery. It led to
a summer house on the side lawn, but this was a
frail shelter from such a tempest as this that
was breaking over the hill.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Steele saw the flutter of a skirt ahead, and
dashed along the path, the rain pelting him as he
ran.
</p>
<p>
“Come back here! Come to the house, you
foolish girl!” he cried, and popped into the summer
house just as the clouds seemed to open above
and the rain descend in a flood.
</p>
<p>
It was so dark, and Mr. Steele was so
blinded for a moment, that he could scarcely see
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>
the figure of whom he was in search. Then he
beheld a girl crouching in a corner, with her hands
over her ears to shut out the roar of the thunder
and her eyes tightly closed to shut out the lightning.
</p>
<p>
“For mercy’s sake! get up and come into the
house. This place will be all a-flood in a minute,”
he gasped.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly, as he dragged the girl to her feet
by one shoulder, he saw that she was not one of
the house party at all. She was a frail, shrinking
girl, in very dirty clothing, and her face and hands
were scratched and dirty, too. A regular ragamuffin
she appeared.
</p>
<p>
“Why—why, where did <em>you</em> come from?”
demanded Mr. Steele.
</p>
<p>
The girl only stuttered and stammered, looking
at him fearfully.
</p>
<p>
“Come on! never mind who you are,” he sputtered.
“This is no place for you in this tempest.
Come into the house!”
</p>
<p>
He set out on a run again for the front veranda,
dragging her after him. The girl did not
cry, although she was certainly badly frightened
by the storm.
</p>
<p>
They reached the door of the big house, saturated.
Here Mr. Steele turned to her again.
</p>
<p>
“Who are you? What are you doing around
here, anyway?” he demanded.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>
</p>
<p>
“Ain’t—ain’t this the place where they got a
bunch of fresh air kids?” asked the girl.
</p>
<p>
“What?” gasped Mr. Steele. “I should say
not! Are you one of those young ones Caslon
has taken to board to the annoyance of the whole
neighborhood? Ha! what were you doing trespassing
on my land?”
</p>
<p>
“I ain’t neither!” returned the girl, pulling
away her hand. “You lemme be.”
</p>
<p>
“I forbade any of you to come up here——”
</p>
<p>
“I ain’t neither,” reiterated the girl. “An’ I
don’t know what you mean. I jest got there.
And I’m lookin’ for the place where the fresh
air kids stay.”
</p>
<p>
In the midst of this the door was drawn open
and Mrs. Steele and some of the girls appeared.
</p>
<p>
“Do come in, Father,” she cried. “Why!
you’re soaking wet. And that child! bring her
in, whoever she is. Oh!”
</p>
<p>
Another flash of lightning made them all cower—all
but Ruth Fielding, who had crept forward
to look over Mrs. Steele’s shoulder. Now she
dashed out and seized the bedrabbled looking
stranger by the hand.
</p>
<p>
“Why, Sadie Raby! who’d ever expect to see
you here? Come in! do let her come in out of
the storm, Mrs. Steele. I know who she is,”
begged Ruth.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span><a name='chXVI' id='chXVI'></a>CHAPTER XVI—THE RUNAWAY</h2>
<p>
Madge said, in something like perplexity:
“You <em>do</em> pick up the strangest acquaintances,
Ruth Fielding. She really does, Ma. But that
has always been Ruth’s way.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Steele was first disturbed over her husband’s
condition. “Go right away and change
into dry garments—do, Father,” she urged.
“You will get your death of cold standing there.
And shut the door. Oh! that lightning!”
</p>
<p>
They had to wait for the thunder to roll away
before they could hear her again, although Mr.
Steele hurried upstairs without another glance at
the bedrabbled child he had brought in out of
the storm.
</p>
<p>
“This—this girl must go somewhere and dry
herself,” hesitated Mrs. Steele, when next she
spoke. “My! isn’t she a sight? Call one of the
maids, someone——”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear Mrs. Steele!” exclaimed Ruth,
eagerly, “let me take Sadie upstairs and look
after her. I am sure I have something she can
put on.”
</p>
<p>
“So have I, if you haven’t,” interposed Helen.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>
“And my clothes will come nearer fitting her
than Ruth’s. Ruth is getting almost as fat as
Heavy!”
</p>
<p>
“There is no need of either of you sacrificing
your clothes,” said Mrs. Steele, slowly. “Of
course, I have plenty of outgrown garments of
my own daughters’ put away. Yes. You take
care of her if you wish, Ruth, and I will hunt out
the things.”
</p>
<p>
Here the strange girl interposed. She had
been darting quick, shrewd glances about the hall
at the girls and boys there gathered, and now
she said:
</p>
<p>
“Ye don’t hafter do nothing for me. A little
rainwater won’t hurt me—I ain’t neither sugar
nor salt. All I wants to know is where them
fresh air kids is stayin’. I ain’t afraid of the
rain—it’s the thunder and lightning that scares
me.”
</p>
<p>
“Goodness knows,” laughed Madge, “I guess
the water wouldn’t hurt you. But we’ll fix you
up a little better, I guess.”
</p>
<p>
“Let Ruth do it,” said Mrs. Steele, sharply.
“She says she knows the girl.”
</p>
<p>
“She’s a friend of mine,” said the girl of the
Red Mill, frankly. “You surely remember me,
Sadie Raby?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I remember ye, Miss,” returned the
runaway. “You was kind to me, too.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>
</p>
<p>
“Come on, then,” said Ruth, briskly. “I’m
only going to be kind to you again—and so is
Mrs. Steele going to be kind. Come on!”
</p>
<p>
An hour later an entirely different looking girl
appeared with Ruth in the big room at the top
of the house which the visiting girls occupied.
Some of them had come upstairs, for the tempest
was over now, and were making ready for dinner
by slow stages, it still being some time off,
and there was nothing else to do.
</p>
<p>
“This is Sadie Raby, girls,” explained Ruth,
quietly. “She is the sister of those cute little
twins that are staying at the Caslons’ place. She
has had a hard time getting here, and because
she hasn’t seen Willie and Dickie for eight
months, or more, she is very anxious to see them.
They are all she has in the world.”
</p>
<p>
“And I reckon they’re a handful,” laughed
Heavy. “Come on! tell us all about it, Sadie.”
</p>
<p>
It was because of the “terrible twins” that
Ruth had gotten Sadie to talk at all. The girl,
since leaving “them Perkinses,” near Briarwood,
had had a most distressful time in many ways,
and she was reticent about her adventures.
</p>
<p>
But she warmed toward Ruth and the others
when she found that they really were sincerely
interested in her trials, and were, likewise, interested
in the twins.
</p>
<p>
“Them kids must ha’ growed lots since I seen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>
’em,” she said, wistfully. “I wrote a letter to a
girl that works right near the orphanage. She
wrote back that the twins was coming out here
for a while. So I throwed up my job at Campton
and hiked over here.”
</p>
<p>
“Dear me! all that way?” cried Helen, pityingly.
</p>
<p>
“I walked farther than that after I left them
Perkinses,” declared Sadie, promptly. “I walked
clean from Lumberton to Cheslow—followed the
railroad most of the way. Then I struck off
through the fields and went to a mill on the river,
and worked there for a week, for an old lady.
She was nice——”
</p>
<p>
“I guess she is!” cried Ruth, quickly. “Didn’t
you know that was <em>my</em> home you went to? And
you worked for Aunt Alvirah and Uncle Jabez.”
</p>
<p>
No, Sadie had not known that. The little old
woman had spoken of there being a girl at the
Red Mill sometimes, but Sadie had not suspected
the identity of that girl.
</p>
<p>
“And then, when you were still near Cheslow,
my brother Tom, and his dog, rescued you from
the tramps,” cried Helen.
</p>
<p>
“Was that your brother, Miss?” responded
Sadie. “Well! he’s a nice feller. He got me a
ride clear to Campton. I’ve been workin’ there
and earnin’ my board and keep. But I couldn’t
save much, and it’s all gone now.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>
</p>
<p>
“But what do you really expect to do here?”
asked Madge Steele, curiously.
</p>
<p>
“I gotter see them kids,” declared Sadie, doggedly.
“Seems to me, sometimes, as though
something would bust right inside of me here,”
and she clutched her dress at its bosom, “if I
don’t see Willie and Dickie. I thought this big
house was likely where the fresh airs was.”
</p>
<p>
“I should say not!” murmured Madge.
</p>
<p>
“They’re all right—don’t you be afraid,” said
Ruth, softly.
</p>
<p>
“I thought mebbe the folks that was keepin’
the kids would let me work for them,” said Sadie,
presently. “For kids is a lot of trouble, and I’m
used to ’em. The matron at the home said I had
a way with young’uns.”
</p>
<p>
She told them a good deal more about her
adventures within the next half hour, but Madge
had left the room just after making her last
speech. While the girls were still listening to the
runaway, a maid rapped at the door.
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Steele will see this—this strange girl in
the library,” announced the servant.
</p>
<p>
Sadie looked a little scared for a moment, and
glanced wildly around the big room for some way
of escape.
</p>
<p>
“Gee! I ain’t got to talk with that man, have
I?” she whispered.
</p>
<p>
“He won’t bite you,” laughed Heavy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>
</p>
<p>
“He’s just as kind as kind can be,” declared
Helen.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll go down with you,” said Ruth, decisively.
“You have plenty of friends now, Sadie. You
mustn’t be expecting to run away all the time.”
</p>
<p>
Sadie Raby went with Ruth doubtfully. The
latter was somewhat disturbed herself when she
saw Mr. Steele’s serious visage.
</p>
<p>
“You’ll excuse me, Mr. Steele?” suggested
Ruth, timidly. “But she is all alone—and I
thought it would encourage her to have me
here——”
</p>
<p>
“That is like your kind heart, Ruth,” said the
gentleman, nodding. “I don’t mind. Madge
has told me her story. It seems that the child
is rather wild—er—flighty, as it were. I suppose
she wants to run away from us, too?”
</p>
<p>
“I ain’t figurin’ to stay here,” said Sadie, doggedly.
“I’m obleeged to you, but this ain’t the
house I was aimin’ for.”
</p>
<p>
“Humph! no. But I am not sure at all that
you would be in good hands down there at Caslon’s.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth was sorry to hear him say this. But
Sadie broke in with: “I don’t keer how they
treat me as long as I’m with my brothers. And
<em>they</em> are down there, this Ruth girl says.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. I quite understand that. But we all
have our duty to perform in this world,” said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>
Mr. Steele, gravely. “I wonder that you have
fallen in with nobody before who has seen the
enormity of letting you run wild throughout the
country. It is preposterous—wrong—impossible!
I never heard of the like before—a child of your
age tramping in the open.”
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t do no harm,” began Sadie, half fearful
of him again.
</p>
<p>
“Of course it is not your fault,” said Mr.
Steele, quickly. “But you were put in the hands
of people who are responsible to the institution
you came from for their treatment of you——”
</p>
<p>
“Them Perkinses?” exclaimed Sadie, fearfully.
“I won’t never go back to them—not
while I’m alive I won’t! I don’t care! I jest
won’t!”
</p>
<p>
She spoke wildly. She turned to run from the
room and would have done so, had not Ruth been
there to stop her and hold her in her arms.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span><a name='chXVII' id='chXVII'></a>CHAPTER XVII—THE BLACK DOUGLASS</h2>
<p>
“Oh, don’t frighten her, Mr. Steele!” begged
Ruth, still holding the half wild girl. “You
would not send her back to those awful people?”
</p>
<p>
“Tut, tut! I am no ogre, I hope,” exclaimed
the gentleman, rather put out of countenance at
this outburst. “I only mean the child well.
Doesn’t she understand?”
</p>
<p>
“I won’t go back to them Perkinses, I tell
you!” cried Sadie, with a stamp of her foot.
</p>
<p>
“It is not my intention to send you back. I
mean to look up your record and the record of
the people you were placed with—Perkins, is it?
The authorities of the institution that had the
care of you, should be made to be more careful
in their selection of homes for their charges.
</p>
<p>
“No. I will keep you here till I have had the
matter sifted. If those—those Perkinses, as you
call them, are unfit to care for you, you shall certainly
not go back to them, my girl.”
</p>
<p>
Sadie looked at him shrewdly. “But I don’t
want to stay here, Mister,” she blurted out.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>
</p>
<p>
“My girl, you are not of an age when you
should be allowed to choose for yourself. Others,
older and wiser, must choose for you. I would
not feel that I was doing right in allowing you
to run wild again——”
</p>
<p>
“I gotter see the twins—I jest <em>gotter</em> see ’em,”
said Sadie, faintly.
</p>
<p>
“And whether that Caslon is fit to have charge
of you,” bitterly added Mr. Steele, “I have my
doubts.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, surely, you will let her see her little
brothers?” cried Ruth, pleadingly.
</p>
<p>
“We will arrange about that—ahem!” said
Mr. Steele. “But I will communicate at once—by
long distance telephone—with the matron of
the institution from which she came, and they
can send a representative here to talk with
me——”
</p>
<p>
“And take me back there?” exclaimed Sadie.
“No, I sha’n’t! I sha’n’t go! So there!”
</p>
<p>
“Hoity-toity, Miss! Let’s have no more of
it, if you please,” said the gentleman, sternly.
“You will stay here for the present. Don’t you
try to run away from me, for if you do, I’ll soon
have you brought back. We intend to treat you
kindly here, but you must not abuse our kindness.”
</p>
<p>
It was perhaps somewhat puzzling to Sadie
Raby—this attitude of the very severe gentleman.
She had not been used to much kindness in her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>
life, and the sort that is forced on one is not
generally appreciated by the wisest of us. Therefore
it is not strange if Sadie failed to understand
that Mr. Steele really meant to be her
friend.
</p>
<p>
“Come away, Sadie,” whispered Ruth, quite
troubled herself by the turn affairs had taken.
“I am so sorry—but it will all come right in
the end——”
</p>
<p>
“If by comin’ right, Miss, you means that I
am goin’ to see them twins, you can jest <em>bet</em> it
will all come right,” returned Sadie, gruffly, when
they were out in the hall. “For see ’em I will,
an’ <em>him</em>, nor nobody else, won’t stop me. As
for goin’ back to them Perkinses, or to the orphanage,
we’ll see ‘bout that,” added Sadie, to
herself, and grimly.
</p>
<p>
Ruth feared very much that Mr. Steele would
not have been quite so stern and positive with
the runaway, had it not been for his dislike for
the Caslons. Had Sadie’s brothers been stopping
with some other neighbor, would Mr. Steele
have delayed letting the runaway girl go to see
them?
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear, me! If folks would only be good-natured
and stop being so hateful to each other,”
thought the girl of the Red Mill. “I just <em>know</em>
that Mr. Steele would like Mr. Caslon a whole
lot, if they really once got acquainted!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span>
</p>
<p>
The rain had ceased falling by this time. The
tempest had rolled away into the east. A great
rainbow had appeared and many of the household
were on the verandas to watch the bow of promise.
</p>
<p>
It was too wet, however, to venture upon the
grass. The paths and driveway glistened with
pools of water. And under a big tree not far
from the front of the house, it was discovered
that a multitude of little toads had appeared—tiny
little fellows no larger than one’s thumbnail.
</p>
<p>
“It’s just been rainin’ toads!” cried one of
the younger Steele children—Bennie by name.
“Come on out, Ruthie, and see the toads that
comed down with the rainstorm.”
</p>
<p>
Tom Cameron had already come up to speak
with Sadie. He shook hands with the runaway
girl and spoke to her as politely as he would
have to any of his sister’s friends. And Sadie,
remembering how kind he had been to her on
the occasion when the tramps attacked her near
Cheslow, responded to his advances with less reluctance
than she had to those of some of the
girls.
</p>
<p>
For it must be confessed that many of the
young people looked upon the runaway askance.
She was so different from themselves!
</p>
<p>
Now that she was clean, and her hair brushed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>
and tied with one of Ruth’s own ribbons, and
she was dressed neatly, Sadie Raby did not <em>look</em>
much different from the girls about her on the
wide porch; but when she spoke, her voice was
hoarse, and her language uncouth.
</p>
<p>
Had she been plumper, she would have been a
pretty girl. She was tanned very darkly, and her
skin was coarse. Nevertheless, given half the
care these other girls had been used to most of
their lives, and Sadie Raby would have been the
equal of any.
</p>
<p>
Ruth came strolling back to the veranda, leaving
Bennie watching the toads—which remained
a mystery to him. He was a lively little fellow
of six and the pet of the whole family.
</p>
<p>
As it chanced, he was alone out there on the
drive, and the others were now strolling farther
and farther away from him along the veranda.
The boy ran out farther from the house, and
danced up and down, looking at the rainbow
overhead.
</p>
<p>
Thus he was—a pretty sight in the glow of the
setting sun—when a sudden chorus of shouts and
frightened cries arose from the rear of the house.
</p>
<p>
Men and maids were screaming. Then came
the pounding of heavy hoofs.
</p>
<p>
Around the curve of the drive charged a great
black horse, a frayed and broken lead-rope hanging
from his arching neck, his eyes red and glowing, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>
his sleek black body all a-quiver with the
joy of his escape.
</p>
<p>
“The Black Douglass!” ejaculated Tom Cameron,
in horror, for the great horse was charging
straight for the dancing child in the driveway.
</p>
<p>
It was the most dangerous beast upon Sunrise
Farm—indeed, almost the only savage creature
Mr. Steele had retained when he bought out the
former owner of the stock farm and his stud of
horses.
</p>
<p>
The Black Douglass was a big creature, with
an uncertain temper, and was handled only by
the most careful men in Mr. Steele’s employ.
Somehow, on this occasion, the brute had been
allowed to escape.
</p>
<p>
Spurring the gravel with his iron shod hoofs,
the horse galloped straight at little Bennie. The
child, suddenly made aware of his peril by the
screams of his brothers and sisters, turned blindly,
staggered a few steps, and fell upon his hands
and knees.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Steele rushed from the house, but he was
too far away. The men chasing the released
animal were at a distance, too. Tom Cameron
started down the steps, but Helen shrieked for
him to return. Who was there to face the snorting,
prancing beast?
</p>
<p>
There was a flash of a slight figure down the
steps and across the sod. Like an arrow from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>
a strong bow, Sadie Raby darted before the fallen
child. Nor was she helpless. The runaway knew
what she was about.
</p>
<p>
As she ran from the veranda, she had seized a
parasol that was leaning against one of the pillars.
Holding this in both hands, she presented
it to the charging horse, opening and shutting it
rapidly as she advanced.
</p>
<p>
She leaped across Bennie and confronted the
Black Douglass. The flighty animal, seeing something
before him that he did not at all understand,
changed his course with a frightened snort, and
dashed off across the lawn, cutting out great
clods as he ran, and so around the house again
and out of sight.
</p>
<p>
Mr. and Mrs. Steele were both running to the
spot. The gentleman picked up the frightened
Bennie, but handed him at once to his mother.
Then he turned and seized the girl by her thin
shoulders.
</p>
<p>
“My dear girl! My dear girl!” he said,
rather brokenly, turning her so as to face him.
“That was a brave thing to do. We can’t thank
you enough. You can’t understand——”
</p>
<p>
“Aw, it warn’t anything. I knowed that horse
wouldn’t jump at us when he seen the umbrel’.
Horses is fools that way,” said Sadie Raby, rather
shamefacedly.
</p>
<p>
But when Mrs. Steele knelt right down in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>
damp gravel beside her, and with one arm around
Bennie, put the other around the runaway and
hugged her—hugged her <em>tight</em>—Sadie was quite
overcome, herself.
</p>
<p>
Madge Steele was crying frankly. Bobbins
came rushing upon the scene, and there was a
general riot of exclamation and explanation.
</p>
<p>
“Say! you goin’ to let me see my brothers
now?” demanded the runaway, who had a practical
mind, if nothing more.
</p>
<p>
“Bob,” said his father, quickly, “you have the
pony put in the cart and drive down there to
Caslon’s and bring those babies up here.”
</p>
<p>
“Aw, Father! what’ll I tell Caslon?” demanded
the big fellow, hesitatingly.
</p>
<p>
“Tell him—tell him——” For a moment, it
was true, that Mr. Steele was rather put to it
for a reply. He found Ruth beside him, plucking
his sleeve.
</p>
<p>
“Let me go with Bobbins, sir,” whispered the
girl of the Red Mill. “I’ll know what to say to
Mr. and Mrs. Caslon.”
</p>
<p>
“I guess you will, Ruth. That’s right. You
bring the twins up here to see their sister.” Then
he turned and smiled down at Sadie, and there
were tears behind his eyeglasses. “If I have my
way, young lady, your coming here to Sunrise
Farm will be the best thing—for you and the
twins—that ever happened in your young lives!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span><a name='chXVIII' id='chXVIII'></a>CHAPTER XVIII—SUNDRY PLANS</h2>
<p>
Perhaps Sadie Raby would have been just as
well pleased had Mr. Steele allowed her to go to
the Caslons’ to see her brothers, instead of having
them brought up the hill to Sunrise Farm.
The gentleman, however, did not do this because
he disliked Caslon; Sadie had saved Bennie from
what might have been certain death, and the
wealthy Mr. Steele was quite as grateful as he
was obstinate.
</p>
<p>
He was determined to show his gratitude to
the friendless girl in a practical manner. And
the object of his gratitude would include her two
little brothers, as well. Oh, yes! Mr. Steele proposed
to make Sadie Raby glad that she had
saved Bennie from the runaway horse.
</p>
<p>
The other girls and boys, beside the members
of the Steele family, were anxious now to show
their approval of Sadie’s brave deed. The wanderer
was quite bewildered at first by all the attention
she received.
</p>
<p>
She was such a different looking girl, too, as
has been already pointed out, from the miserable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>
little creature who had been found by Mr. Steele
in the shrubbery, that it was not hard to develop
an interest in Sadie Raby.
</p>
<p>
Encircled by the family and their young visitors
on the veranda, Sadie again related the particulars
of her life and experience—and it was
a particularly sympathetic audience that listened
to her. Mr. Steele drew out a new detail that
had escaped Ruth, even, in her confidences with
the strange child.
</p>
<p>
Although the “terrible twins” were unable to
remember either father or mother—orphan asylums
are not calculated to encourage such remembrances
in infant minds—Sadie, as she had
once said to Ruth, could clearly remember both
her parents.
</p>
<p>
And although they had died in distant Harburg,
where the children had been put into the
orphanage, Sadie remembered that the family
had removed to that city, soon after the twins
were born, from no less a place than Darrowtown!
</p>
<p>
“Me, I got it in my head that mebbe somebody
would remember pa and mom in Darrowtown,
and would give me a chance. That’s another
reason I come hiking clear over here,” said Sadie.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll hunt your friends up—if there are
any,” Mr. Steele assured her.
</p>
<p>
Sadie looked at him shrewdly. “Say!” said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span>
she, “you treat me a whole lot nicer than you
did a while ago. Do folks have to do somethin’
for your family before you forget to be cross
with them?”
</p>
<p>
It certainly was a facer! Mr. Steele flushed a
little and scarcely knew what to say in reply to
this frank criticism. But at that moment the
two-wheel cart came into sight with the pony on
the trot, and Ruth and the twins waving their
hands and shouting.
</p>
<p>
The meeting of the little chaps with their
runaway sister was touching. The three Raby
orphans were very popular indeed at Sunrise
Farm just then.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Steele frankly admitted that this might be
a case where custom could be over-ridden, and the
orphanage authorities ignored.
</p>
<p>
“Whether those Perkins people she was
farmed out to, were as harsh as she says——” he
began, when Ruth interrupted eagerly:
</p>
<p>
“Oh, sir! I can vouch for <em>that</em>. The man
was an awful brute. He struck <em>me</em> with his whip,
and I don’t believe Sadie told a story when she
says he beat her.”
</p>
<p>
“I wish I’d been there,” ejaculated Tom Cameron,
in a low voice, “when the scoundrel struck
you, Ruth. I would have done something to
him!”
</p>
<p>
“However,” pursued Mr. Steele, “the girl is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>
here now and near to Darrowtown, which she
says is her old home. We may find somebody
there who knew the Rabys. At any rate, they
shall be cared for—I promise you.”
</p>
<p>
“I know!” cried Ruth, suddenly. “If anybody
will remember them, it’s Miss Pettis.”
</p>
<p>
“Another of your queer friends, Ruth?” asked
Madge, laughing.
</p>
<p>
“Why—Miss True Pettis isn’t queer. But she
knows about everybody who lives in Darrowtown,
or who ever did live there—and their histories
from away back!”
</p>
<p>
“A human encyclopedia,” exclaimed Heavy.
</p>
<p>
“She’s a lovely lady,” said Ruth, quietly, “and
she’ll do anything to help these unfortunate Rabys—be
sure of that.”
</p>
<p>
The late dinner was announced, and by that
time the twins, as well as Sadie, had become a little
more used to their surroundings. Willie and
Dickie had been put into “spandy clean” overalls
and shirts before Mrs. Caslon would let them out
of her hands. They were really pretty children,
in a delicate way, like their sister.
</p>
<p>
With so many about the long dining table,
the meals at the Steele home at this time were
like a continuous picnic. There was so much talking
and laughter that Mr. and Mrs. Steele had to
communicate with signs, for the most part, from
their stations at either end of the table, or else
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span>
they must send messages back and forth by one
of the waitresses.
</p>
<p>
The twins and Sadie were down at Mrs. Steele’s
end of the table on this occasion, with the girls
all about them. Ruth and the others took a lot
more interest in keeping the orphans supplied
with good things than they did in their own
plates.
</p>
<p>
That is, all but Heavy; of course <em>she</em> wasted
no time in heaping her own plate. The twins
were a little bashful at first; but it was plain that
Willie and Dickie had been taught some of the
refinements of life at the orphanage, as both had
very good table manners.
</p>
<p>
They had to be tempted to eat, however, and
finally Heavy offered to run a race with them, declaring
that she could eat as much as both of the
boys put together.
</p>
<p>
Dickie was just as silent in his sister’s presence
as usual, his communications being generally in
the form of monosyllables. But he was faithful
in echoing Willie’s sentiments on any and every
occasion—noticeably at chicken time. The little
fellows ate the fricassee with appetite, but they
refused the nice, rich gravy, in which the cook
had put macaroni. Mrs. Steele urged them to
take gravy once or twice, and finally Sadie considered
that she should come to the rescue.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter with you kids?” she demanded, hoarsely,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>
in an attempt to communicate
with them aside. “Ye was glad ’nough to git
chicken gravy on Thanksgivin’ at the orphanage—warn’t
ye?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I know, Sadie,” returned Willie, wistfully.
“But they never left the windpipes in it—did
they, Dickie?”
</p>
<p>
“Nope,” responded Dickie, feelingly, likewise
gazing at the macaroni askance.
</p>
<p>
It set the table in a roar and finally Willie and
Dickie were encouraged to try some of the gravy,
“windpipes” and all!
</p>
<p>
“They’re all right,” laughed Busy Izzy, greatly
delighted. “They’re one—or two—of the
seven wonders of the world——”
</p>
<p>
“Pooh!” interrupted Heavy, witheringly,
“You don’t even know what the seven wonders
of the world are.”
</p>
<p>
“I can tell you one thing they’re <em>not</em>,” grinned
Busy Izzy. “They’re not a baseball team, for
there’s not enough of them. Now will you be
good?”
</p>
<p>
Madge turned her head suddenly and ran
right into Belle Tingley’s elbow, as Belle was
reaching up to settle her hair-ribbon.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, oh! My eye! I believe you poked it
out, Belle. You have <em>such</em> sharp elbows,” wailed
Madge.
</p>
<p>
“You’ll have to see Doc. Blodgett at Lumberton,”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>
advised Heavy, “and get your eye tended
to. He’s a great old doctor——”
</p>
<p>
“Why, I didn’t know he was an eye doctor,”
exclaimed Madge. “I thought he was a chiropodist.”
</p>
<p>
“He used to be,” Heavy returned, with perfect
seriousness. “He began at the foot and worked
up, you see.”
</p>
<p>
Amid all the fun and hilarity, Mr. Steele
called them to order. This was at the dessert
stage, and there were tall cones of parti-colored
ice cream before them, with great, heaping plates
of cake.
</p>
<p>
“Can you give me a moment’s attention, girls
and boys?” asked their host. “I want to speak
about to-morrow.”
</p>
<p>
“The ‘great and glorious,’” murmured
Heavy.
</p>
<p>
“We’ve all promised to be good, sir,” said
Tom. “No pistols, or explosives, on the place.”
</p>
<p>
“Only the cannon,” interposed Bobbins.
“You’re going to let us salute with <em>that</em>; eh,
Pa?”
</p>
<p>
“I’m not sure that I shall,” returned his father,
“if you do not give me your attention, and
keep silent. We are determined to have a safe
and sane Fourth on Sunrise Farm. But at night
we will set off a splendid lot of fireworks that I
bought last week——”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, fine, Pa! I do love fireworks,” cried
Madge.
</p>
<p>
“The girls are as bad as the boys, Mother,”
said Mr. Steele, shaking his head. “What I
wanted to say,” he added, raising his voice, “was
that we ought to invite these little chaps—these
brothers of Sadie Raby—to come up at night to
see our show.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, let’s have all the fresh airs, Pa!” cried
Madge, eagerly. “<em>What</em> a good time they’d
have.”
</p>
<p>
“I—don’t—know,” said her father, soberly,
looking at his wife. “I am afraid that will be too
much for your mother.”
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Caslon has some fireworks for the children,”
broke in Ruth, timidly. “I happen to know
that. And Tom was going down to buy ten dollar’s
worth more to put with what Mr. Caslon
has.”
</p>
<p>
“Humph!” said Mr. Steele.
</p>
<p>
“You see, some of us thought we’d give the little
folk a good time down there, and it wouldn’t
bother you and Mrs. Steele, sir,” Ruth hastened
to explain.
</p>
<p>
“Well, well!” exclaimed the gentleman, not
very sharply after all, “if those Caslons can
stand the racket, I guess mother and I can—eh,
mother?”
</p>
<p>
“We need not have them in the house,” said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>
Mrs. Steele. “We can put tables on the veranda,
and give them ice cream and cake after the fireworks.
Get the men to hang Chinese lanterns,
and so forth.”
</p>
<p>
“Bully!” cried the younger Steeles, in chorus,
and the visitors to Sunrise Farm were quite delighted,
too, with this suggestion.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span><a name='chXIX' id='chXIX'></a>CHAPTER XIX—A SAFE AND SANE FOURTH?</h2>
<p>
Of course, somebody had to go to the Caslons
and explain all this, and that duty devolved
upon Ruth. Naturally, permission had to be
sought of the farmer and his wife before the
“fresh air kids” could be carried off bodily to
Sunrise Farm.
</p>
<p>
It was decided that the ten dollars, of which
Tom had taken charge, should be spent for extra
bunting and lanterns to decorate with, and to buy
little gifts for each of the fresh airs to find next
his or her plate on the evening of the Fourth.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, Tom started again for Darrowtown
right after breakfast, and Ruth rode with
him in the high, two-wheeled cart.
</p>
<p>
Ruth had two important errands. One was
in Darrowtown. But the first stop, at Mr. Caslon’s,
troubled her a little.
</p>
<p>
How would the farmer and his wife take the
idea of the Steeles suddenly patronizing the
fresh air children? Were the Caslons anything
like Mr. Steele himself, in temperament, Ruth’s
errand would not be a pleasant one, she knew.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span>
</p>
<p>
The orphans ran out shrieking a welcome when
Tom drove into the yard of the house under the
hill. Where were the “terrible twins”? Had
their sister really come to see them? Were Willie
and Dickie coming back to the orphanage at all?
</p>
<p>
These and a dozen other questions were hurled
at Ruth. Some of the bigger girls remembered
Sadie Raby and asked a multitude of questions
about her. So the girl of the Red Mill contented
herself at first with trying to reply to all these
queries.
</p>
<p>
Then Mrs. Caslon appeared from the kitchen,
wiping her hands of dish-water, and the old farmer
himself came from the stables. Their friendly
greeting and smiling faces opened the way for
Ruth’s task. She threw herself, figuratively
speaking, into their arms.
</p>
<p>
“I know you are both just as kind as you can
be,” said Ruth, eagerly, “and you won’t mind if
I ask you to change your program a little to-day
for the youngsters? They want to give them all
a good time up at Sunrise Farm.”
</p>
<p>
“Good land!” exclaimed Mrs. Caslon. “Not
<em>all</em> of them?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, ma’am,” said Ruth, and she sketched
briefly the idea of the celebration on the hill-top,
including the presents she and Tom were to buy
in Darrowtown for the kiddies.
</p>
<p>
“My soul and body!” exclaimed the farmer’s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>
wife. “That lady, Mis’ Steele, don’t know what
she’s runnin’ into, does she, Father?”
</p>
<p>
“I reckon not,” chuckled Mr. Caslon, wagging
his head.
</p>
<p>
“But you won’t mind? You’ll let us have the
children?” asked Ruth, anxiously.
</p>
<p>
“Why——” Mrs. Caslon looked at the old
gentleman. But he was shaking all over with
inward mirth.
</p>
<p>
“Do ’em good, Mother—do ’em good,” he
chuckled—and he did not mean the fresh air
children, either. Ruth could see that.
</p>
<p>
“It’ll be a mortal shame,” began Mrs. Caslon,
again, but once more her husband interrupted:
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you fuss about other folks, Mother,”
he said, gravely. “It’ll do ’em good—mebbe—as
I say. Nothin’ like tryin’ a game once by the
way. And I bet twelve little tykes like these ’uns
will keep that Steele man hoppin’ for a while.”
</p>
<p>
“But his poor wife——”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you worry, Mrs. Caslon,” Ruth urged,
but wishing to laugh, too. “We girls will take
care of the kiddies, and Mrs. Steele sha’n’t be
bothered too much.”
</p>
<p>
“Besides,” drawled Mr. Caslon, “the woman’s
got a good sized family of her own—there’s
six or seven of ’em, ain’t there?” he demanded
of Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Eight, sir.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>
</p>
<p>
“But that don’t make a speck of difference,”
the farmer’s wife interposed. “She’s always had
plenty of maids and the like to look out for them.
She don’t know——”
</p>
<p>
“Let her learn a little, then,” said Mr. Caslon,
good naturedly enough. “It’ll do both him and
her good. And it’ll give you a rest for a few
hours, Mother.
</p>
<p>
“Besides,” added Mr. Caslon, with another
deep chuckle, “I hear Steele has been rantin’
around about takin’ the kids to board just for
the sake of spitin’ the neighbors. Now, if he
thinks boardin’ a dozen young’uns like these is
all fun——”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t be harsh, John,” urged Mrs. Caslon.
</p>
<p>
“I ain’t! I ain’t!” cried the farmer, laughing
again. “But they’re bitin’ off a big chaw, and it
tickles me to see ’em do it.”
</p>
<p>
It was arranged, therefore, that the orphans
should be ready to go up to Sunrise Farm that
afternoon. Then Ruth and Tom drove to Darrowtown.
They had a fast horse, and got over
the rough road at a very good pace.
</p>
<p>
Tom drove first around into the side street
where Miss True Pettis’s little cottage was situated.
</p>
<p>
“You dear child!” was the little spinster’s
greeting. “Are you having a nice time with your
rich friends at Sunrise Farm? Tell me all about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>
them—and the farm. Everybody in Darrowtown
is that curious!”
</p>
<p>
Tom had driven away to attend to the errands
he could do alone, so Ruth could afford the
time to visit a bit with her old friend. The felon
was better, and that fact being assured, Ruth considered
it better to satisfy Miss Pettis regarding
the Sunrise Farm folk before getting to the Raby
orphans.
</p>
<p>
And that was the way to get to them, too.
For the story of the tempest the day before, and
the appearance of Sadie Raby, the runaway, and
her reunion with the twins, naturally came into
the tale Ruth had to tell—a tale that was eagerly
listened to and as greatly enjoyed by the Darrowtown
seamstress, as one can well imagine.
</p>
<p>
“Just like a book—or a movie,” sighed Miss
Pettis, shaking her head. “It’s really wonderful,
Ruthie Fielding, what’s happened to you since
you left us here in Darrowtown. But, I always
said, this town is dead and nothing really happens
<em>here</em>!”
</p>
<p>
“But it’s lovely in Darrowtown,” declared
Ruth. “And just to think! Those Raby children
lived here once.”
</p>
<p>
“No?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes they did. Sadie was six or seven years
old, I guess, when they left here. Tom Raby was
her father. He was a mason’s helper——”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you tell me another thing about ’em!”
cried Miss Pettis, starting up suddenly. “Now
you remind me. I remember them well. Mis’
Raby was as nice a woman as ever stepped—but
weakly. And Tom Raby——
</p>
<p>
“Why, how could I forget it? And after that
man from Canady came to trace ’em, too, only
three years ago. Didn’t you ever hear of it,
Ruth?”
</p>
<p>
“What man?” asked Ruth, quite bewildered
now. “Are—are you sure it was the same family?
And <em>who</em> would want to trace them?”
</p>
<p>
“Lemme see. Listen!” commanded Miss
Pettis. “You answer me about these poor children.”
</p>
<p>
And under the seamstress’s skillful questioning
Ruth related every detail she knew about the Raby
orphans—and Mr. Steele, in her presence, had
cross-questioned Sadie exhaustively the evening
before. The story lost nothing in Ruth’s telling,
for she had a retentive memory.
</p>
<p>
“My goodness me, Ruthie!” ejaculated the
spinster, excitedly. “It’s the same folks—sure.
Why, do you know, they came from Quebec, and
there’s some property they’ve fell heir to—property
from their mother’s side—Oh, let me tell
you! Funny you never heard us talkin’ about
that Canady lawyer while you was livin’ here with
me. My!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span><a name='chXX' id='chXX'></a>CHAPTER XX—THE RABY ROMANCE</h2>
<p>
Miss True Pettis thrilled with the joy of
telling the romance. The little seamstress had
been all her life entertaining people with the dry
details of unimportant neighborhood happenings.
It was only once in a long while that a story like
that of the Rabys’ came within her ken.
</p>
<p>
“Why, do you believe me!” she said to Ruth,
“that Mis’ Raby came of quite a nice family in
Quebec. Not to say Tom Raby wasn’t a fine
man, for he was, but he warn’t educated much
and his trade didn’t bring ’em more’n a livin’.
But her folks had school teachers, and doctors,
and even ministers in their family—yes, indeed!
</p>
<p>
“And it seems like, so the Canady lawyer said,
that a minister in the family what was an uncle
of Mis’ Raby’s, left her and her children some
property. It was in what he called ‘the fun’s’—that’s
like stocks an’ bonds, I reckon. But them
Canadians talk different from us.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I can remember that man—tall, lean
man he was, with a yaller mustache. He had
traced the Rabys to Darrowtown, and he saw
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>
the minister, and Deacon Giles, and Amoskeag
Lanfell, askin’ did they know where the Rabys
went when they moved away from here.
</p>
<p>
“I was workin’ for Amoskeag’s wife that day,
so I heard all the talk,” pursued Miss Pettis. “He
said—this Canady lawyer did—that the property
amounted to several thousand dollars. It
was left by the minister (who had no family of
his own) to his niece, Mis’ Raby, or to her children
if she was dead.
</p>
<p>
“Course they asked me if <em>I</em> knowed what became
of the family,” said the spinster, with some
pride. “It bein’ well known here in Darrowtown
that I’m most as good as a parish register—and
why wouldn’t I be? Everybody expects me
to know all the news. But if I ever <em>did</em> know
where them Rabys went, I’d forgot, and I told
the lawyer man so.
</p>
<p>
“But he give me his card and axed me to write
to him if I ever heard anything further from ’em,
or about ’em. And I certain sure would have
done so,” declared Miss Pettis, “if it had
ever come to my mind.”
</p>
<p>
“Have you the gentleman’s card now, Miss
True?” asked Ruth, eagerly.
</p>
<p>
“I s’pect so.”
</p>
<p>
“Will you find it? I know Mr. Steele is interested
in the Rabys, and he can communicate
with this Canadian lawyer——”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>
</p>
<p>
“Now! ain’t you a bright girl?” cried the
spinster. “Of course!”
</p>
<p>
She at once began to hustle about, turning things
out of her bureau drawers, searching the cubby
holes of an old maple “secretary” that had
set in the corner of the kitchen since her father’s
time, discovering things which she had mislaid
for years—and forgotten—but not coming upon
the card in question right away.
</p>
<p>
“Of course I’ve got it,” she declared. “I
never lose anything—I never throw a scrap of
anything away that might come of use——”
</p>
<p>
And still she rummaged. Tom came back with
the cart and Ruth had to go shopping. “But do
look, Miss Pettis,” she begged, “and we’ll stop
again before we go back to the farm.”
</p>
<p>
Tom and she were some time selecting a dozen
timely, funny, and attractive nicknacks for the
fresh airs. But they succeeded at last, and Ruth
was sure the girls would be pleased with their
selections.
</p>
<p>
“So much better than spending the money for
noise and a powder smell,” added Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Humph! the kids would like the noise all
right,” sniffed Tom. “I heard those little chaps
begging Mr. Caslon for punk and firecrackers.
That old farmer was a boy himself once, and
I bet he got something for them that will smell
of powder, beside the little tad of fireworks he
showed me.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh! I hope they won’t any of them get
burned.”
</p>
<p>
“Kind of put a damper on the ‘safe and sane
Fourth’ Mr. Steele spoke about, eh?” chuckled
Tom.
</p>
<p>
Miss Pettis was looking out of the window and
smiling at them when they arrived back at the
cottage. She held in her hand a yellowed bit of
pasteboard, which she passed to the eager Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Where do you suppose I found it, Ruthie?”
she demanded.
</p>
<p>
“I couldn’t guess.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, stuck right into the corner of my lookin’-glass
in my bedroom. I s’pose I have handled
it every day I’ve dusted that glass for three year,
an’ then couldn’t remember where it was. Ain’t
that the beatenes’?”
</p>
<p>
Ruth and Tom drove off in high excitement.
She had already told Master Tom all about the
Raby romance—such details as he did not already
know—and now they both looked at the yellowed
business card before Ruth put it safely away in
her pocket:
</p>
<div class='center'>
<p>  <span class='sc'>Mr. Angus MacDorough</span></p>
<p>  <em>Solicitor</em></p>
<p>  13, King Crescent, Quebec</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span></div>
<p>
“Mr. Steele will go right ahead with this, I
know,” said Tom, nodding. “He’s taken a fancy
to those kids——”
</p>
<p>
“Well! he ought to, to Sadie!” cried Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Sure. And he’s a generous man, after all.
Too bad he’s taken such a dislike to old Caslon.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear, Tom! we ought to fix that,” sighed
Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Crickey! you’d tackle any job in the world, I
believe, Ruthie, if you thought you could help
folks.”
</p>
<p>
“Nonsense! But both of them—both Mr.
Steele and Mr. Caslon—are such awfully nice
people——”
</p>
<p>
“Well! there’s not much hope, I guess. Mr.
Steele’s lawyer is trying to find a flaw in Caslon’s
title. It seems that, way back, a long time ago,
some of the Caslons got poor, or careless, and
the farm was sold for taxes. It was never properly
straightened out—on the county records,
anyway—and the lawyer is trying to see if he
can’t buy up the interest of whoever bought the
farm in at that time—or their heirs—and so have
some kind of a basis for a suit against old Caslon.”
</p>
<p>
“Goodness! that’s not very clear,” said Ruth,
staring.
</p>
<p>
“No. It’s pretty muddy. But you know how
some lawyers are. And Mr. Steele is willing to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>
hire the shyster to do it. He thinks it’s all
right. It’s business.”
</p>
<p>
“<em>Your</em> father wouldn’t do such a thing, Tom!”
cried Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“No. I hope he wouldn’t, anyway,” said Master
Tom, wagging his head. “But I couldn’t say
that to Bobbins when he told me about it, could
I?”
</p>
<p>
“No call to. But, oh, dear! I hope Mr.
Steele won’t be successful. I do hope he won’t
be.”
</p>
<p>
“Same here,” grunted Tom. “Just the same,
he’s a nice man, and I like him.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes—so do I,” admitted Ruth. “But I’d
like him so much more, if he wouldn’t try to get
the best of an old man like Mr. Caslon.”
</p>
<p>
The Raby matter, however, was a more pleasant
topic of conversation for the two friends.
The big bay horse got over the ground rapidly—Tom
said the creature did not know a hill when
he saw one!—and it still lacked half an hour of
noon when they came in sight of Caslon’s house.
</p>
<p>
The orphans were all in force in the front yard.
Mr. Caslon appeared, too.
</p>
<p>
That yard was untidy for the first time since
Ruth had seen it. And most of the untidiness
was caused by telltale bits of red, yellow, and
green paper. Even before the cart came to the
gate, Ruth smelled the tang of powder smoke.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Tom! they <em>have</em> got firecrackers,” she
exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
“So have I—a whole box full—under the
front seat,” chuckled Tom. “What’s the Fourth
without a weeny bit of noise? Bobbins and I
are going to let them off in a big hogshead he’s
found behind the stable.”
</p>
<p>
“You boys are rascals!” breathed Ruth.
“Why! there are the twins!”
</p>
<p>
Sadie’s young brothers ran out to the cart.
Mr. Caslon appeared with a good-sized box in
his arms, too.
</p>
<p>
“Just take this—and the youngsters—aboard,
will you, young fellow?” said the farmer.
“Might as well have all the rockets and such up
there on the hill. They’ll show off better. And
the twins was down for the clean clo’es mother
promised them.”
</p>
<p>
It was a two-seated cart and there was plenty
of room for the two boys on the back seat. Mr.
Caslon carefully placed the open box in the bottom
of the cart, between the seats. The fireworks
he had purchased had been taken out of their
wrappings and were placed loosely in the box.
</p>
<p>
“There ye are,” said the farmer, jovially.
“Hop up here, youngsters!”
</p>
<p>
He seized Willie and hoisted him into the seat.
But Dickie had run around to the other side of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>
the cart and clambered up like a monkey, to join
his brother.
</p>
<p>
“All right, sir,” said Tom, wheeling the eager
bay horse. It was nearing time for the latter’s
oats, and he smelled them! “Out of the way,
kids. They’ll send a wagon down for you, all
right, after luncheon, I reckon.”
</p>
<p>
Just then Ruth happened to notice something
smoking in Dickie’s hand.
</p>
<p>
“What have you there, child?” she demanded.
“Not a nasty cigarette?”
</p>
<p>
He held out, solemnly, and as usual wordlessly,
a smoking bit of punk.
</p>
<p>
“Where did you get that? Oh! drop it!”
cried Ruth, fearing for the fireworks and the
explosives under the front seat. She meant for
Dickie to throw it out of the wagon, but the
youngster took the command literally.
</p>
<p>
He dropped it. He dropped it right into the
box of fireworks. Then things began to happen!
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span><a name='chXXI' id='chXXI'></a>CHAPTER XXI—A VERY BUSY TIME</h2>
<p>
“Oh, Tom!” shrieked Ruth, and seized the
boy’s arm. The bay horse was just plunging
ahead, eager to be off for the stable and his
manger. The high cart was whirled through the
gateway as the first explosion came!
</p>
<p>
Pop,pop,pop! sputter—BANG!
</p>
<p>
It seemed as though the horse leaped more
than his own length, and yanked all four wheels
of the cart off the ground. There was a chorus
of screams in the Caslons’ dooryard, but after
that first cry, Ruth kept silent.
</p>
<p>
The rockets shot out of the box amidships with
a shower of sparks. The Roman candles sprayed
their varied colored balls—dimmed now by daylight—all
about the cart.
</p>
<p>
Tom hung to the lines desperately, but the
scared horse had taken the bit in his teeth and
was galloping up the road toward Sunrise Farm,
quite out of hand.
</p>
<p>
After that first grab at Tom’s arm, Ruth did
not interfere with him. She turned about, knelt
on the seat-cushion, and, one after the other,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>
swept the twins across the sputtering, shooting
bunch of fireworks, and into the space between
her and Tom and the dashboard.
</p>
<p>
Providentially the shooting rockets headed into
the air, and to the rear. As the big horse dashed
up the hill, swinging the light vehicle from side
to side behind him, there was left behind a trail
of smoke and fire that (had it been night-time)
would have been a brilliant spectacle.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Caslon and the orphans started after the
amazing thing tearing up the road—but to no
purpose. Nothing could be done to stop the
explosion now. The sparks flew all about. Although
Mr. Caslon had bought a wealth of small
rockets, candles, mines, flower-pots, and the like,
never had so many pieces been discharged in so
short a time!
</p>
<p>
It was sputter, sputter, bang, bang, the cart
vomiting flame and smoke, while the horse became
a perfectly frenzied creature, urged on by
the noise behind him. Tom could only cling to
the reins, Ruth clung to the twins, and all by
good providence were saved from an overturn.
</p>
<p>
All the time—and, of course, the half-mile or
more from Caslons’ to the entrance to the Steele
estate, was covered in a very few moments—all
the time Ruth was praying that the fire-crackers
Tom had bought and hidden under the front seat
would not be ignited.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>
</p>
<p>
The reports of the rockets, and the like, became
desultory. Some set pieces and triangles
went off with the hissing of snakes. Was the
explosion over?
</p>
<p>
So it seemed, and the maddened horse turned
in at the gateway. The cart went in on two
wheels, but it did not overturn.
</p>
<p>
The race had begun to tell on the bay. He
was covered with foam and his pace was slackening.
Perhaps the peril was over—Ruth drew a
long breath for the first time since the horse had
made its initial jump.
</p>
<p>
And then—with startling suddenness—there
was a sputter and bang! Off went the firecrackers,
package after package. A spark had
burned through the paper wrapper and soon there
was such a popping under that front seat as
shamed the former explosions!
</p>
<p>
Had the horse been able to run any faster, undoubtedly
he would have done so; but as the cart
went tearing up the drive toward the front of the
big house, the display of fireworks, etc., behind
the front seat, and the display of alarm on the
part of the four on the seat, advertised to all beholders
that the occasion was not, to say the least,
a common one.
</p>
<p>
The cart itself was scorched and was afire in
places, the sputtering of the fire-crackers continued
while the horse tore up the hill. Tom had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>
bought a generous supply and it took some time
for them all to explode.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately the front drop of the seat was a
solid panel of deal, or Ruth’s skirt might have
caught on fire—or perhaps the legs of the twins
would have been burned.
</p>
<p>
As for the two little fellows, they never even
squealed! Their eyes shone, they had lost their
caps in the back of the cart, their short curls blew
out straight in the wind, and their cheeks glowed.
When the runaway appeared over the crest of
the hill and the crowd at Sunrise Farm beheld
them, it was evident that Willie and Dickie were
enjoying themselves to the full!
</p>
<p>
Poor Tom, on whose young shoulders the responsibility
of the whole affair rested, was braced
back, with his feet against the footboard, the lines
wrapped around his wrists, and holding the maddened
horse in to the best of his ability.
</p>
<p>
Bobbins on one side, and Ralph Tingley on the
other, ran into the roadway and caught the runaway
by the bridle. The bay was, perhaps, quite
willing to halt by this time. Mr. Steele ran out,
and his first exclamation was:
</p>
<p>
“My goodness, Tom Cameron! you’ve finished
that horse!”
</p>
<p>
“I hope not, sir,” panted Tom, rather pale.
“But I thought he’d finish us before he got
through.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>
</p>
<p>
By this time the explosions had ceased. Everything
of an explosive nature—saving the twins
themselves—in the cart seemed to have gone off.
And now Willie ejaculated:
</p>
<p>
“Gee! I never rode so fast before. Wasn’t
it great, Dickie?”
</p>
<p>
“Yep,” agreed Master Dickie, with rather
more emphasis than usual.
</p>
<p>
Sister Sadie appeared from the rear premises,
vastly excited, too, but when she lifted the twins
down and found not a scratch upon them, she
turned to Ruth with a delighted face.
</p>
<p>
“You took care of them just like you loved
’em, Miss,” she whispered, as Ruth tumbled out
of the cart, too, into her arms. “Oh, dear! don’t
you dare get sick—you ain’t hurt, are you?”
</p>
<p>
“No, no!” exclaimed Ruth, having hard work
to crowd back the tears. “But I’m almost scared
to death. That—that young one!” and she
grabbed at Dickie. “What did you drop that
punk into the fireworks for?”
</p>
<p>
“Huh?” questioned the imperturbable Dickie.
</p>
<p>
“Why didn’t you throw that lighted punk
away?” and Ruth was tempted to shake the
little rascal.
</p>
<p>
But instantly the voluble Willie shouldered his
way to the front. “Gee, Miss! he thought you
wanted him to drop it right there. You said so.
An’—an’—— Well, he didn’t know the things
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span>
in the box would go off of themselves. Did you
Dickie?”
</p>
<p>
“Nope,” responded his twin.
</p>
<p>
“Do forgive ’em, Miss Ruth,” whispered
Sadie Raby. “I wouldn’t want Mr. Steele to
get after ’em. You know—he can be sumpin’
fierce!”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” sighed Ruth Fielding, “they’re the
‘terrible twins’ right enough. Oh, Tom!” she
added, as young Cameron came to her to shake
hands.
</p>
<p>
“You’re getting better and better,” said Tom,
grinning. “I’d rather be in a wreck with you,
Ruthie—of almost any kind—than with anybody
else I know. Those kids don’t even know what
you saved them from, when you dragged ’em over
the back of that seat.”
</p>
<p>
“Sh!” she begged, softly.
</p>
<p>
“And it’s a wonder we weren’t all blown to
glory!”
</p>
<p>
“It was a mercy we were not seriously hurt,”
agreed Ruth.
</p>
<p>
But then there was too much bustle and general
talk for them to discuss the incident quietly. The
horse was led away to the stable and there attended
to. Fortunately he was not really injured,
but the cart would have to go to the painter’s.
</p>
<p>
“A fine beginning for this celebration we have
on hand,” declared Mr. Steele, looking ruefully
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>
at his wife. “If all that can happen with only
two of those fresh air kids, as Bob calls them, on
hand, what do you suppose will happen to-night
when we have a dozen at Sunrise Farm?”
</p>
<p>
“Mercy!” gasped the lady. “I am trembling
in my shoes—I am, indeed. But we have agreed
to do it, Father, and we must carry it through.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span><a name='chXXII' id='chXXII'></a>CHAPTER XXII—THE TERRIBLE TWINS ON THE RAMPAGE</h2>
<p>
The girls who had come to Sunrise Farm to
visit at Madge Steele’s invitation, felt no little
responsibility when it came to the entertainment
for the fresh air orphans. As The Fox said,
with her usual decision:
</p>
<p>
“Now that we’ve put Madge and her folks
into this business, we’ll just have to back up their
play, and make sure that the fresh airs don’t tear
the place down. And that Sadie will have to keep
an eye on the ‘terrible twins.’ Is that right?”
</p>
<p>
“I’ve spoken to poor Sadie,” said Ruth, with
a sigh. “I am afraid that Mrs. Steele is very
much worried over what may occur to-night, while
the children are here. We’ll have to be on the
watch all the time.”
</p>
<p>
“I should say!” exclaimed Heavy Stone.
“Let’s suggest to Mr. Steele that he rope off a
place out front where he is going to have the
fireworks. Some of those little rascals will want
to help celebrate, the way Willie and Dickie did,”
and the plump girl giggled ecstatically.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>
</p>
<p>
“’Twas no laughing matter, Jennie,” complained
Ruth, shaking her head.
</p>
<p>
“Well, that’s all right,” Lluella broke in. “If
Tom hadn’t bought the fire-crackers—and that
was right against Mr. Steele’s advice——”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, here now!” interrupted Helen, loyal to
her twin. “Tom wasn’t any more to blame
than Bobbins. They were just bought for a
joke.”
</p>
<p>
“It was a joke all right,” Belle said, laughing.
“Who’s going to pay for the damage to the
cart?”
</p>
<p>
“Now, let’s not get to bickering,” urged Ruth.
“What’s done, is done. We must plan now to
make the celebration this afternoon and evening
as easy for Mrs. Steele as possible.”
</p>
<p>
This conversation went on after luncheon, while
Bob and Tom had driven down the hill with a
big wagon to bring up the ten remaining orphans
from Mr. Caslon’s place.
</p>
<p>
The gaily decorated wagon came in sight just
about this time. Fortunately the decorations Tom
and Ruth had purchased that forenoon in Darrowtown
had not been destroyed when the fireworks
went off in the cart.
</p>
<p>
The girls from Briarwood Hall welcomed the
fresh airs cheerfully and took entire charge of the
six little girls. The little boys did not wish to
play “girls’ games” on the lawn, and therefore
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>
Bob and his chums agreed to keep an eye on the
youngsters, including the “terrible twins.”
</p>
<p>
Sadie had been drafted to assist Madge and
her mother, and some of the maids, in preparing
for the evening collation. Therefore the visitors
were divided for the time into two bands.
</p>
<p>
The girls from the orphanage were quiet
enough and well behaved when separated from
their boy friends. Indeed, on the lawn and under
the big tent Mr. Steele had had erected, the celebration
of a “safe and sane” Fourth went on in
a most commendable way.
</p>
<p>
It was a very hot afternoon, and after indulging
in a ball game in the field behind the stables,
Bobbins, in a thoughtless moment, suggested a
swim. Half a mile away there was a pond in a
hollow. The boys had been there almost every
day for a dip, and Bob’s suggestion was hailed—even
by the usually thoughtful Tom Cameron—with
satisfaction.
</p>
<p>
“What about the kids?” demanded Ralph
Tingley.
</p>
<p>
“Let them come along,” said Bobbins.
</p>
<p>
“Sure,” urged Busy Izzy. “What harm can
come to them? We’ll keep our eyes on them.”
</p>
<p>
The twins and their small chums from the
orphanage were eager to go to the pond, too, and
so expressed themselves. The half-mile walk
through the hot sun did not make them quail.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>
They were proud to be allowed to accompany the
bigger boys to the swimming hole.
</p>
<p>
The little fellows raced along in their bare
feet behind the bigger boys and were pleased
enough, until they reached the pond and learned
that they would only be allowed to go in wading,
while the others slipped into their bathing trunks
and “went in all over.”
</p>
<p>
“No! you can’t go in,” declared Bobbins, who
put his foot down with decision, having his own
small brothers in mind. (They had been left
behind, by the way, to be dressed for the evening.)
</p>
<p>
“Say! the water won’t wet us no more’n it does
you—will it, Dickie?” demanded the talkative
twin.
</p>
<p>
“Nope,” agreed his brother.
</p>
<p>
“Now, you kids keep your clothes on,” said
Bob, threateningly. “And don’t wade more
than to your knees. If you get your overalls wet,
you’ll hear about it. You know Mrs. Caslon fixed
you all up for the afternoon and told you to keep
clean.”
</p>
<p>
The smaller chaps were unhappy. That was
plain. They paddled their dusty feet in the water
for a while, but the sight of the older lads diving
and swimming and having such a good time in
the pond was a continual temptation. The active
minds of the terrible twins were soon at work.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>
Willie began to whisper to Dickie, and the latter
nodded his head solemnly.
</p>
<p>
“Say!” blurted out Willie, finally, as Bob and
Tom were racing past them in a boisterous game
of “tag.” “We wanter go back. This ain’t no
fun—is it, Dickie?”
</p>
<p>
“Nope,” said his twin.
</p>
<p>
“Go on back, if you want to. You know the
path,” said Bobbins, breathlessly.
</p>
<p>
“We’re goin’, too,” said one of the other fresh
airs.
</p>
<p>
“We’d rather play with the girls than stay
here. Hadn’t we, Dickie?” proposed Willie
Raby.
</p>
<p>
“Yep,” agreed Master Dickie, with due solemnity.
</p>
<p>
“Go on!” cried Bob. “And see you go
straight back to the house. My!” he added to
Tom, “but those kids are a nuisance.”
</p>
<p>
“Think we ought to let them go alone?”
queried Tom, with some faint doubt on the subject.
“You reckon they’ll be all right, Bobbins?”
</p>
<p>
“Great Scott! they sure know the way to the
house,” said Bob. “It’s a straight path.”
</p>
<p>
But, as it happened, the twins had no idea of
going straight to the house. The pond was fed
by a stream that ran in from the east. The little
fellows had seen this, and Willie’s idea was to
circle around through the woods and find that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>
stream. There they could go in bathing like the
bigger boys, “and nobody would ever know.”
</p>
<p>
“Our heads will be wet,” objected one of the
orphans.
</p>
<p>
“Gee!” said Willie Raby, “don’t let’s wet our
heads. We ain’t got to—have we?”
</p>
<p>
“Nope,” said his brother, promptly.
</p>
<p>
There was some doubt, still, in the minds of
the other boys.
</p>
<p>
“What you goin’ to say to those folks up to
the big house?” demanded one of the fresh airs.
</p>
<p>
“Ain’t goin’ to say nothin’,” declared the bold
Willie. “Cause why? they ain’t goin’ to know—‘nless
you fellers snitch.”
</p>
<p>
“Aw, who’s goin’ to snitch?” cried the objector,
angered at once by the accusation of the
worst crime in all the category of boyhood. “We
ain’t no tattle-tales—are we, Jim?”
</p>
<p>
“Naw. We’re as safe to hold our tongues as
you an’ yer brother are, Willie Raby—so now!”
</p>
<p>
“Sure we are!” agreed the other orphans.
</p>
<p>
“Then come along,” urged the talkative twin.
“Nobody’s got to know.”
</p>
<p>
“Suppose yer sister finds it out?” sneered one.
</p>
<p>
“Aw—well—she jes’ ain’t go’n’ ter,” cried
Willie, exasperated. “An’ what if she does?
She runned away herself—didn’t she?”
</p>
<p>
The spirit of restlessness was strong in the
Raby nature, it was evident. Willie was a born
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span>
leader. The others trailed after him when he
left the pathway that led directly back to Sunrise
Farm, and pushed into the thicker wood in the
direction he believed the stream lay.
</p>
<p>
The juvenile leader of the party did not know
(how should he?) that just above the pond the
stream which fed it made a sharp turn. Its
waters came out of a deep gorge, lying in an entirely
different direction from that toward which
the “terrible twins” and their chums were aiming.
</p>
<p>
The little fellows plodded on for a long time,
and the sun dropped suddenly behind the hills to
the westward, and there they were—quite surprisingly
to themselves—in a strange and fast-darkening
forest.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span><a name='chXXIII' id='chXXIII'></a>CHAPTER XXIII—LOST</h2>
<p>
The girl visitors from Briarwood Hall did all
they could to help the mistress of Sunrise Farm
and Madge prepare for the evening festivities,
and not alone in employing the attention of the
six little girls from the orphanage.
</p>
<p>
There were the decorations to arrange, and
the paper lanterns to hang, and the long tables
on the porch to prepare for the supper. Twelve
extra, hungry little mouths to feed was, of itself,
a fact of no small importance.
</p>
<p>
When the wagon had come up from Caslon’s
with the orphans, Mrs. Steele had thought it
rather a liberty on the part of the farmer’s wife
because she had, with the children, sent a great
hamper of cakes, which she (Mrs. Caslon) herself
had baked the day before.
</p>
<p>
But the cakes were so good, and already the
children were so hungry, that the worried mistress
of the big farm was thankful that these supplies
were in her pantry.
</p>
<p>
“When the boys come back from the pond, I
expect they will be ravenous, too,” sighed the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>
good lady. “<em>Do</em> you think, Madge, that there
will be enough ham and tongue sandwiches for
supper? I am sure of the cream and cake—thanks
to that good old woman (though I hope
your father won’t hear me say it). But that is
to be served after the fireworks. They will want
something hearty at suppertime—and goodness
me, Madge! It is five o’clock now. Those boys
should be back from their swim.”
</p>
<p>
As for Mr. Steele, he was immensely satisfied
with the celebration of the day so far. To tell
the truth, he had very little to do with the work
of getting ready for the orphans’ entertainment.
Aside from the explosion of the fireworks in the
cart, the occasion had been a perfectly “safe and
sane” celebration of a holiday that he usually
looked forward to with no little dread.
</p>
<p>
Before anybody really began to worry over
their delay, the boys came into view. They had
had a refreshing swim and announced the state
of their appetites the moment they joined the girls
at the big tent.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, yes,” said Madge, “we know all about
that, Bobbie dear. But his little tootie-wootsums
must wait till hims gets his bib put on, an’ let
sister see if his hannies is nice and clean. Can’t
sit down to eat if hims a dirty boy,” and she
rumpled her big brother’s hair, while he looked
foolish enough over her “baby talk.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>
</p>
<p>
“Don’t be ridiculous, Madge,” said Helen,
briskly. “Of course they are hungry—— But
where’s the rest of them?”
</p>
<p>
“The rest of what?” demanded Busy Izzy.
“I guess we’re all here.”
</p>
<p>
“Say! you <em>must</em> be hungry,” chuckled Heavy.
“Did you eat the kids?”
</p>
<p>
“What kids?” snapped Tom, in sudden alarm.
</p>
<p>
“The fresh airs, of course. The ‘terrible
twins’ and their mates. My goodness!” cried
Ann Hicks, “you didn’t forget and leave them
down there at the pond, did you?”
</p>
<p>
The boys looked at each other for a moment.
“What’s the joke?” Bobbins finally drawled.
</p>
<p>
“It’s no joke,” Ruth said, quickly. “You
don’t mean to say that you forgot those little
boys?”
</p>
<p>
“Now, stop that, Ruth Fielding!” cried Isadore
Phelps, very red in the face. “A joke’s a
joke; but don’t push it too far. You know very
well those kids came back up here more’n an
hour ago.”
</p>
<p>
“They didn’t do any such thing,” cried Sadie,
having heard the discussion, and now running out
to the tent. “They haven’t been near the house
since you big boys took them to the pond. Now,
say! what d’ye know about it?”
</p>
<p>
“They’re playing a trick on us,” declared Tom,
gloomily.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>
</p>
<p>
“Let’s hunt out in the stables, and around,”
suggested Ralph Tingley, feebly.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe they went back to Caslon’s,” Isadore
said, hopefully.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll find out about that pretty quick,” said
Madge. “I’ll tell father and he’ll send somebody
down to see if they went there.”
</p>
<p>
“Come on, boys!” exclaimed Tom, starting
for the rear of the house. “Those little scamps
are fooling us.”
</p>
<p>
“Suppose they <em>have</em> wandered away into the
woods?” breathed Ruth to Helen. “Whatever
shall we do?”
</p>
<p>
Sadie could not wait. She was unable to remain
idle, when it was possible that the twin
brothers she had so lately rejoined, were in danger.
She flashed after the boys and hunted the
stables, too.
</p>
<p>
Nobody there had seen the “fresh airs” since
they had followed the bigger boys to the pond.
</p>
<p>
“And ye sure didn’t leave ’em down there?”
demanded Sadie Raby of Tom.
</p>
<p>
“Goodness me! No!” exclaimed Tom.
“They couldn’t go in swimming as we did, and
so they got mad and wouldn’t stay. But they
started right up this way, and we thought they
were all right.”
</p>
<p>
“They might have slanted off and gone across
the fields to Caslon’s,” said Bobbins, doubtfully.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>
</p>
<p>
“That would have taken them into the back
pasture where Caslon keeps his Angoras—wouldn’t
it?” demanded the much-worried young
man.
</p>
<p>
“Well, you can go look for ’em with the
goats,” snapped Sadie, starting off. “But me for
that Caslon place. If they didn’t go there, then
they are in the woods somewhere.”
</p>
<p>
She started down the hill, fleet-footed as a dog.
Before Mr. Steele had stopped sputtering over the
catastrophe, and bethought him to start somebody
for the Caslon premises to make inquiries, Sadie
came in view again, with the old, gray-mustached
farmer in tow.
</p>
<p>
The serious look on Mr. Caslon’s face was
enough for all those waiting at Sunrise Farm to
realize that the absent children were actually lost.
Tom and Bobbins had come up from the goat
pasture without having seen, or heard, the six
little fellows.
</p>
<p>
“I forgot to tell ye,” said Caslon, seriously,
“that ye had to keep one eye at least on them
‘terrible twins’ all the time. We locked ’em
into their bedroom at night. No knowin’ when
or where they’re likely to break out. But I reckoned
this here sister of theirs would keep ’em
close to her——”
</p>
<p>
“Well!” snapped Sadie Raby, eyeing Tom
and Bobbins with much disfavor, “I thought that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>
a bunch of big fellers like them could look after
half a dozen little mites.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Steele had come forward slowly; the fact
that the six orphan boys really seemed to be lost,
was an occasion to break down even <em>his</em> barrier
of dislike for the neighbor. Besides, Mr. Caslon
ignored any difference there might be between
them in a most generous manner.
</p>
<p>
“I blame myself, Neighbor Steele—I sure do,”
Mr. Caslon said, before the owner of Sunrise
Farm could speak. “I’d ought to warned you
about them twins. They got bit by the runaway
bug bad—that’s right.”
</p>
<p>
“Humph! a family trait—is it?” demanded
Mr. Steele, rather grimly eyeing the sister of the
runaways.
</p>
<p>
“I couldn’t say about that,” chuckled the
farmer. “But Willie and Dickie started off
twice from our place, trailin’ most of the other
kids with ’em. But I caught ’em in time. Now,
their sister tells me, they’ve got at least an hour
and a half’s start.”
</p>
<p>
“It is getting dark—or it will soon be,” said
Mr. Steele, nervously. “If they are not found
before night, I shall be greatly disturbed. I feel
as though I were responsible. My oldest boy,
here——”
</p>
<p>
“Now, it ain’t nobody’s fault, like enough,”
interrupted Mr. Caslon, cheerfully, and seeing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>
Bobbins’s woebegone face. “We’ll start right
out and hunt for them.”
</p>
<p>
“But if it grows dark——”
</p>
<p>
“Let me have what men you can spare, and
all the lanterns around the place,” said Caslon,
briskly, taking charge of the matter on the instant.
“These bigger boys can help.”
</p>
<p>
“I—I can go with you, sir,” began Mr. Steele,
but the farmer waved him back.
</p>
<p>
“No. You ain’t used to the woods—nor to
trampin’—like I be. And it won’t hurt your boys.
You leave it to us—we’ll find ’em.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Steele had retired to the tent on the lawn
in tears, and most of the girls were gathered
about her. Sadie Raby clung to Farmer Caslon’s
side, and nobody tried to call her back.
</p>
<p>
Since returning from Darrowtown that morning,
Ruth Fielding had divulged to Mr. Steele all
she had discovered through Miss True Pettis regarding
the Raby family, and about the Canadian
lawyer who had once searched for Mrs. Raby
and her children.
</p>
<p>
The gentleman had expressed deep interest
in the matter, and while the fresh air children
were being entertained during the afternoon, Mr.
Steele had already set in motion an effort to
learn the whereabouts of Mr. Angus MacDorough
and to discover just what the property was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>
that had been willed to the mother of the Raby
orphans.
</p>
<p>
Sadie had been told nothing about this wonderful
discovery as yet. Indeed, there had been no
time. Sadie had been busy, with Mrs. Steele and
the others, in preparing for that “safe and sane”
celebration with which Mr. Steele had desired to
entertain the “terrible twins” and their little
companions at Sunrise Farm.
</p>
<p>
Now this sudden catastrophe had occurred.
The loss of the six little boys was no small trouble.
It threatened to be a tragedy.
</p>
<p>
Down there beyond the pond the mountainside
was heavily timbered, and there were many dangerous
ravines and sudden precipices over which a
careless foot might stray.
</p>
<p>
Dusk was coming on. In the wood it would already
be dark. And if the frightened children
went plunging about, seeking, in terror, to escape,
they might at any moment be cast into some pit
where the searchers would possibly never find
them.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Steele felt his responsibility gravely. He
was, at best, a nervous man, and this happening
assumed the very gravest outlines in his anxious
mind.
</p>
<p>
“Never ought to have let them out of my own
sight,” he sputtered, having Ruth for a confidant.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>
“I might have known something extraordinary
would happen. It was a crazy thing to have all
those children up here, anyway.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear, Mr. Steele!” cried Ruth, much
worried, “<em>that</em> is partly my fault. I was one of
those who suggested it.”
</p>
<p>
“Nonsense! nonsense, child! Nobody blames
you,” returned the gentleman. “I should have
put my foot down and said ‘No.’ Nobody influenced
me at all. Why—why, I <em>wanted</em> to give the
poor little kiddies a nice time. And now—see
what has come of it?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, it may be that they will be found almost
at once,” cried Ruth, hopefully. “I am sure Mr.
Caslon will do what he can——”
</p>
<p>
“Caslon’s an eminently practical man—yes, indeed,”
admitted Mr. Steele, and not grudgingly.
“If anybody can find them, he will, I have no
doubt.”
</p>
<p>
And this commendation of the neighbor whom
he so disliked struck Ruth completely silent for
the time being.

<p>
“And here it is ‘ong past suppertime,” groaned
Heavy; “it’s getting darker every minute, and the
fireworks ought to be set off, and we can’t do a
thing!”
</p>
<p>
“Who’d have the heart to eat, with those children
wandering out there in the woods?” snapped
Mercy Curtis.
</p>
<p>
“What’s <em>heart</em> got to do with eating?” grumbled
the plump girl. “And I was thinking quite
as much of the little girls here as I was of myself.
Why! here is one of the poor kiddies
asleep, I do declare.”
</p>
<p>
The party in the big tent was pretty solemn.
Even the six little girls from the orphanage could
not play, or laugh, under the present circumstances.
And, in addition, it looked as though all
the fun for the evening would be spoiled.
</p>
<p>
The searching party had been gone an hour.
Those remaining behind had seen the twinkling
lanterns trail away over the edge of the hill and
disappear. Now all they could see from the tent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>
were the stars, and the fireflies, with now and then
a rocket soaring heavenward from some distant
farm, or hamlet, where the Glorious Fourth was
being fittingly celebrated.
</p>
<p>
Madge and Helen came out with a hamper of
sandwiches and there was lemonade, but not even
the little folk ate with an appetite. The day
which, at Sunrise Farm, was planned to be so
memorable, threatened now to be remembered
for a very unhappy cause.
</p>
<p>
Down in the wood lot that extended from below
some of Mr. Steele’s hayfields clear into the next
township, the little party of searchers, led by old
Mr. Caslon, had separated into parties of two
each, to comb the wilderness.
</p>
<p>
None of the men knew the wood as did Mr.
Caslon, and of course the boys and Sadie (who
had refused to go back) were quite unfamiliar
with it.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t go out of sight of the flash of each
other’s lanterns,” advised the farmer.
</p>
<p>
And by sticking to this rule it was not likely
that any of the sorely troubled searchers would,
themselves, be lost. As they floundered through
the thick undergrowth, they shouted, now and
then, as loudly as they could. But nothing but
the echoes, and the startled nightbirds, replied.
</p>
<p>
Again and again they called for the lost boys
by name. Sadie’s shrill voice carried as far as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>
anybody’s, without doubt, and her crying for
“Willie” and “Dickie” should have brought
those delinquents to light, had they heard her.
</p>
<p>
Sadie stuck close to Mr. Caslon, as he told her
to. But the way through the brush was harder
for the girl than for the rest of them. Thick
mats of greenbriars halted them. They were
torn, and scratched, and stung by the vegetable
pests; yet Sadie made no complaint.
</p>
<p>
As for the mosquitoes and other stinging insects—well,
they were out on this night, it seemed,
in full force. They buzzed around the heads of
the searchers in clouds, attracted by the lanterns.
Above, in the trees, complaining owls hooted their
objections to the searchers’ presence in the forest.
The whip-poor-wills reiterated their determination
from dead limbs or rotting fence posts. And
in the wet places the deep-voiced frogs gave tongue
in many minor keys.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear!” sighed Sadie to the farmer, “the
little fellers will be scared half to death when
they hear all these critters.”
</p>
<p>
“And how about you?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I’m used to ’em. Why, I’ve slept out
in places as bad as this more’n one night. But
Willie and Dickie ain’t used to it.”
</p>
<p>
One end of the line of searchers touched the
pond. They shouted that information to the
others, and then they all pushed on. It was in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>
the mind of all that, perhaps, the children had
circled back to the pond.
</p>
<p>
But their shouts brought no hoped-for reply,
although they echoed across the open water, and
were answered eerily from the farther shore.
</p>
<p>
There were six couples; therefore the line extended
for a long way into the wood, and swept a
wide area. They marched on, bursting through
the vines and climbers, searching thick patches
of jungle, and often shouting in chorus till the
wood rang again.
</p>
<p>
Tom and one of the stablemen, who were at
the lower end of the line, finally came to the
mouth of that gorge out of which the brook
sprang. To the east of this opening lay a considerable
valley and it was decided to search
this vale thoroughly before following the stream
higher.
</p>
<p>
It was well they did so, for half a mile farther
on, Tom and his companion made a discovery.
They came upon the tall, blasted trunk of a huge
old tree that had a great hollow at its foot. This
hollow was blinded by a growth of vines and
brush, yet as Tom flashed his lantern upon it, it
seemed to him as though the vines had been disturbed.
</p>
<p>
“It may be the lair of some animal, sir,” suggested
the stableman, as Tom attempted to peer
in.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>
</p>
<p>
“Nothing much more dangerous than foxes in
these woods now, I am told,” returned the boy.
“And this is not a fox’s burrow—hello!”
</p>
<p>
His sudden, delighted shriek rang through the
wood and up the hillside.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve found them! I’ve found them!” the
boy repeated, and dived into the hollow tree.
</p>
<p>
His lantern showed him and the stableman
the six wanderers rolled up like kittens in a
nest. They opened their eyes sleepily, yawning
and blinking. One began to snivel, but Willie
Raby at once delivered a sharp punch to that one,
saying, in grand disgust:
</p>
<p>
“Baby! Didn’t I tell you they’d come for us?
They was sure to—wasn’t they, Dickie?”
</p>
<p>
“Yep,” responded that youngster, quite as cool
about it as his brother.
</p>
<p>
Tom’s shouts brought the rest of the party in
a hurry. Mr. Caslon hauled each “fresh air” out
by the collar and stood him on his feet. When
he had counted them twice over to make sure, he
said:
</p>
<p>
“Well, sir! of all the young scamps that ever
were born—Willie Raby! weren’t you scared?”
</p>
<p>
“Nope,” declared Willie. “Some of these
other kids begun ter snivel when it got dark; but
Dickie an’ me would ha’ licked ’em if they’d kep’
that up. Then we found that good place to
sleep——”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>
</p>
<p>
“But suppose it had been the bed of some
animal?” asked Bobbins, chuckling.
</p>
<p>
“Nope,” said Willie, shaking his head. “There
was spider webs all over the hole we went in at,
so we knowed nobody had been there much lately.
And it was a pretty good place to sleep. Only it
was too warm in there at first. I couldn’t get to
sleep right away.”
</p>
<p>
“But you didn’t hear us shouting for you?”
queried one of the other searchers.
</p>
<p>
“Nope. I got to sleep. You see, I thought
about bears an’ burglars an’ goblins, an’ all those
sort o’ things, an’ that made me shiver, so I went
to sleep,” declared the earnest twin.
</p>
<p>
A shout of laughter greeted this statement.
The searchers picked up the little fellows and
carried them down to the edge of the pond, where
the way was much clearer, and so on to the plain
path to Sunrise Farm.
</p>
<p>
So delighted were they to have found the six
youngsters without a scratch upon them, that nobody—not
even Mr. Caslon—thought to ask the
runaways how they had come to wander so far
from Sunrise Farm.
</p>
<p>
It was ten o’clock when the party arrived at
the big house on the hill. Isadore had run ahead
to tell the good news and everybody was aroused—even
to the six fellow-orphans of the runaways—to
welcome the wanderers.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>
</p>
<p>
“My goodness! let’s have the fireworks and
celebrate their return,” exclaimed Madge.
</p>
<p>
But Mr. Steele quickly put his foot down
on that.
</p>
<p>
“I am afraid that Willie and Dickie, and Jim
and the rest of them, ought really to be punished
for their escapade, and the trouble and fright they
have given us,” declared the proprietor of Sunrise
Farm.
</p>
<p>
“However, perhaps going without their supper
and postponing the rest of the celebration until
to-morrow night, will be punishment enough. But
don’t you let me hear of you six boys trying to run
away again, while you remain with Mr. and Mrs.
Caslon,” and he shook a threatening finger at the
wanderers.
</p>
<p>
“Now Mr. and Mrs. Caslon will take you
home,” for the big wagon had been driven around
from the stables while he was speaking. Mrs.
Caslon, too worried to remain in doubt about the
fresh airs, had trudged away up the hill to Sunrise
Farm, while the party was out in search of the
lost ones.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Steele and the girls bade a cordial good-night
to the farmer’s wife, as she climbed up to
the front seat of the vehicle on one side. On the
other, Mr. Steele stopped Mr. Caslon before he
could climb up.
</p>
<p>
“The women folks have arranged for you and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>
your wife to come to-morrow evening and help
take care of these little mischiefs, while we finish
the celebration,” said the rich man, with a detaining
hand upon Mr. Caslon’s shoulder. “We
need you.”
</p>
<p>
“I reckon so, neighbor,” said the farmer,
chuckling. “We’re a little more used to them
lively young eels than you be.”
</p>
<p>
“And—and we want you and your wife to come
for your own sakes,” added Mr. Steele, in some
confusion. “We haven’t even been acquainted
before, sir. I consider that I am at fault, Caslon.
I hope you’ll overlook it and—and—as you say
yourself—<em>be neighborly</em>.”
</p>
<p>
“Sure! Of course!” exclaimed the old man,
heartily. “Ain’t no need of two neighbors bein’
at outs, Mr. Steele. You’ll find that soft words
butter more parsnips than any other kind. If you
an’ I ain’t jest agreed on ev’ry p’int, let’s get together
an’ settle it ourselves. No need of lawyers’
work in it,” and the old farmer climbed nimbly
to the high seat, and the wagon load of cheering,
laughing youngsters started down the hill.
</p>
<p>
“And so <em>that’s</em> all right,” exclaimed the delighted
Ruth, who had heard the conversation between
the two men, and could scarcely hide her
delight in it.
</p>
<p>
“I feel like dancing,” she said to Helen. “I
just <em>know</em> Mr. Steele and Mr. Caslon will understand
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>
each other after this, and that there will be
no quarrel between them over the farms.”
</p>
<p>
Which later results proved to be true. Not
many months afterward, Madge wrote to Ruth
that her father and the old farmer had come to
a very satisfactory agreement. Mr. Caslon had
agreed to sell the old homestead to Mr. Steele
for a certain price, retaining a life occupancy of
it for himself and wife, and, in addition, the
farmer was to take over the general superintendency
of Sunrise Farm for Mr. Steele, on a yearly
salary.
</p>
<p>
“So much for the work of the ‘terrible
twins’!” Ruth declared when she heard this, for
the girl of the Red Mill did not realize how
much she, herself, had to do with bringing about
Mr. Steele’s change of attitude toward his neighbor.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span><a name='chXXV' id='chXXV'></a>CHAPTER XXV—THE ORPHANS’ FORTUNE</h2>
<p>
A great deal happened at Sunrise Farm before
these later occurrences which so delighted Ruth
Fielding. The excitement of the loss of the six
“fresh airs” was not easily forgotten. Whenever
any of the orphans was on the Sunrise premises
again, they had a bodyguard of older girls
or boys who kept a bright lookout that nothing
unusual happened to them.
</p>
<p>
As for the twins, Sadie took them in hand with
a reformatory spirit that amazed Willie and
Dickie. Those two youngsters were kept at Sunrise
Farm and put in special charge of Sadie.
Thus Mr. Steele had the three Raby orphans
under his own eye until he could hear from Canada,
and from the orphanage, and learn all the
particulars of the fortune that might be in store
for them.
</p>
<p>
After a bit Willie and Dickie found the watchfulness
of their sister somewhat irksome.
</p>
<p>
“Say!” the talkative twin observed, “you ain’t
got no reason to be so sharp on us, Sadie Raby.
<em>You</em> run away your ownself—didn’t she,
Dickie?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yep,” agreed the oracular one.
</p>
<p>
“An’ we don’t want no gal follerin’ us around
and tellin’ us to ‘stop’ all the time—do we,
Dickie?”
</p>
<p>
“Nope.”
</p>
<p>
“We’re big boys now,” declared Willie, strutting
like the young bantam he was. “There ain’t
nothin’ goin’ to hurt us. We’re too big——”
</p>
<p>
“What’s that on your finger—— No! the
other one?” snapped Sadie, eyeing Willie sharply.
</p>
<p>
“Scratch,” announced the boy.
</p>
<p>
“Where’d you get it?”
</p>
<p>
“I—I cut it on the cat,” admitted Willie, with
less bombast.
</p>
<p>
“Humph! you’re a big boy—ain’t you? Don’t
even know enough to let the cat alone—and I
hope her claw done you some good. Come here
an’ let me borrer Miss Ruth’s peroxide bottle and
put some on it. Cat’s claws is poison,” said Sadie.
“You ain’t so fit to get along without somebody
watchin’ you as ye think, kid. Remember that,
now.”
</p>
<p>
“We don’t want no gal trailin’ after us all the
time!” cried Willie, angrily. “An’ we ain’t
goin’ to stand it,” and he kicked his bare toe into
the sand to express the emphasis that his voice
would not vent.
</p>
<p>
“Humph!” said Sadie, eyeing him sideways,
meanwhile trimming carefully a stout branch she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>
had broken from the lilac bush. “So you want
to be your own boss, do you, Willie Raby?”
</p>
<p>
“We <em>be</em> our own boss—ain’t we, Dickie?”
</p>
<p>
For the first time, the echo of Dickie’s agreement
failed to materialize. Dickie was eyeing
that lilac sprout—and looked from that to his
sister’s determined face. He backed away several
feet and put his hands behind him.
</p>
<p>
“And so you ain’t goin’ to mind me—nor Miss
Ruth—nor Mr. Steele—nor Mr. Caslon—nor nobody?”
proceeded Sadie, more earnestness apparent
in each section of her query.
</p>
<p>
Her hand reached out suddenly and gripped
Willie by the shoulder of his shirt. He tried to
writhe out of her grasp, but his sister’s muscles
were hardened, and she was twice as strong as
Willie had believed. The lilac sprout was raised.
</p>
<p>
“So you’re too big to mind anybody, heh?”
she queried.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, we be!” snarled the writhing Willie.
“Ain’t we, Dickie?”
</p>
<p>
“No, we’re not!” screamed his twin, suddenly,
refusing to echo Willie’s declaration. “Don’t hit
him, Sade! Oh, don’t!” and he cast himself upon
his sister and held her tight about the waist.
“We—we’ll be good,” he sobbed.
</p>
<p>
“How about it, Willie Raby?” demanded the
stern sister, without lowering the stick. “Are
you goin’ to mind and be good?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>
</p>
<p>
Willie stared, tried to writhe away, saw it was
no use, and capitulated. “Aw—yes—if <em>he’s</em> goin’
to cry about it,” he grumbled. He said it with
an air intimating that Dickie was, after all, quite
a millstone about his neck and would always
be holding him back from deeds of valor
which Willie, himself, knew he could perform.
</p>
<p>
However, the twins behaved pretty well after
that. They remained with Sadie at Sunrise Farm,
for the whole Steele family had become interested
in them.
</p>
<p>
The inquiries Mr. Steele set afoot resulted, in
a short time, in information of surprising moment
to the three Raby orphans. The old inquiry
which had brought the lawyer, Mr. Angus MacDorough,
to Darrowtown three years before, was
ferreted out by another lawyer engaged by Mr.
Steele.
</p>
<p>
It was found that Mr. MacDorough had, soon
after his visit to the States in the matter of the
Raby fortune, been stricken ill and, after a long
sickness, had died. His affairs had never been
straightened out, and his business was still in a
chaotic state.
</p>
<p>
However, it was found beyond a doubt that
Mr. MacDorough had been engaged to search out
the whereabouts of Mrs. Tom Raby and her children
by the administrators of the estate of Mrs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>
Raby’s elderly relative, now some time deceased.
</p>
<p>
Nearly two thousand dollars in American
money had been left as a legacy to the Rabys. In
time this property was put into Mr. Steele’s care
to hold in trust for the three orphans—and it was
enough to promise them all an education and a
start in life.
</p>
<p>
Had it not been so, Mr. and Mrs. Steele would
have felt sufficiently in Sadie’s debt, because of
her having saved little Bennie Steele from the
hoofs of the Black Douglass, to have made the
girl’s way—and that of the twins—plain before
them, until they were grown.
</p>
<p>
How much Ruth Fielding and her chum, Helen,
were delighted by all this can be imagined. Sadie
held an almost worshipful attitude toward Ruth;
Ruth had been her first real friend when she ran
away from “them Perkinses.”
</p>
<p>
That Ruth and her chum bore the affairs of the
Raby orphans in mind, and continued to have
many other and varied interests, as well as a multitude
of adventures during the summer, will be
explained in the next volume of our series, to be
entitled: “Ruth Fielding and the Gypsies; Or,
The Missing Pearl Necklace.”
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, the visit to Sunrise Farm came to
a glorious close. The belated Fourth of July
was celebrated on the evening of the fifth, in a
perfectly “safe and sane” manner by the burning of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>
the wealth of fireworks that Mr. Steele
had supplied.
</p>
<p>
The days that followed to the end of the stay
of the girls of Briarwood Hall and their brothers,
were filled with delightful incidents. Picnics, fishing
parties, tramps over the hills, rides, games on
the lawn, and many other activities occupied the
delightful hours at Sunrise Farm.
</p>
<p>
“This surely is the nicest place I ever was at,”
Busy Izzy admitted, on the closing day of the
party. “If I have as good a time the rest of
the summer, I won’t mind going back to school
and suffering for eight months in the year.”
</p>
<p>
“Hear! hear!” cried Heavy Jennie Stone.
“And the eats!”
</p>
<p>
“And the rides,” said Mercy Curtis, the lame
girl. “Such beautiful rides through the hills!”
</p>
<p>
“And such a fine time watching those fresh airs
to see that they didn’t kill themselves,” added
Tom Cameron, with a grimace.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t say a word against the poor little dears,
Tommy,” urged his sister. “Suppose <em>you</em> had to
live in an for orphanage all but four weeks in the
year?”
</p>
<p>
“Tom is only fooling,” Ruth said, quietly. “I
know him. He enjoyed seeing the children have
a good time, too.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! if you say so, Miss Fielding,” said Tom,
laughing and bowing to her, “it must be so.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>
</p>
<p>
The big yellow coach, with the four prancing
horses, came around to the door. Bobbins
mounted to the driver’s seat and gathered up the
ribbons. The visitors climbed aboard.
</p>
<p>
Ruth stood up and waved her hand to the rest
of the Steele family, and Sadie and the twins gathered
on the porch.
</p>
<p>
“We’ve had the finest time ever!” she cried.
“We love you all for giving us such a nice vacation.
And we’re going to cheer you——”
</p>
<p>
And cheer they did. At the noise, the leaders
sprang forward and the yellow coach rolled away.
Ruth, laughing, sat down suddenly beside her
chum, and Helen hugged her tight.
</p>
<p>
“We always have a dandy time when we go
anywhere with <em>you</em>, Ruth,” she declared. “For
you always take your ‘good times’ with you.”
</p>
<p>
And perhaps Helen Cameron had made a very
important discovery.

<i>This new series of girls’ books is in a new
style of story writing. The interest is in
knowing the girls and seeing them solve the
problems that develop their character. Incidentally,

is imparted.</i>
</p>
<p>
1. THE LINGER-NOTS AND THE MYSTERY HOUSE
<i>or The Story of Nine Adventurous Girls</i>
</p>
<p>
How the Linger-Not girls met and formed
their club seems commonplace, but this
writer makes it fascinating, and how they

<i>or the Great West Point Chain</i>

</p>
<p>
3. THE LINGER-NOTS AND THEIR GOLDEN QUEST
<i>or The Log of the Ocean Monarch</i>
</p>
<p>
For a club of girls to become involved in a mystery leading back
into the times of the California gold-rush, seems unnatural until
the reader sees how it happened, and how the girls helped one of
their friends to come into her rightful name and inheritance, forms
a fine story.
</p>
<p>
4. THE LINGER-NOTS AND THE WHISPERING CHARM
<i>or The Secret from Old Alaska</i>
</p>
<p>
Whether engrossed in thrilling adventures in the Far North or

to her and to themselves.

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
